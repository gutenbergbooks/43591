<h2>Introduction</h2>


<p>If for no other reasons than because of the long time and
monumental patience expended upon its preparation, the
vicissitudes through which it has passed and the varied and
arduous labors bestowed upon it by the author and his editors,
the history of Alexander Wheelock Thayer’s Life of Beethoven
deserves to be set forth as an introduction to this work. His
work it is, and his monument, though others have labored long
and painstakingly upon it. There has been no considerable time
since the middle of the last century when it has not occupied the
minds of the author and those who have been associated with
him in its creation. Between the conception of its plan and its
execution there lies a period of more than two generations. Four
men have labored zealously and affectionately upon its pages, and
the fruits of more than four score men, stimulated to investigation
by the first revelations made by the author, have been conserved
in the ultimate form of the biography. It was seventeen years
after Mr. Thayer entered upon what proved to be his life-task
before he gave the first volume to the world&mdash;and then in a foreign
tongue; it was thirteen more before the third volume came from
the press. This volume, moreover, left the work unfinished, and
thirty-two years more had to elapse before it was completed.
When this was done the patient and self-sacrificing investigator
was dead; he did not live to finish it himself nor to see it finished
by his faithful collaborator of many years, Dr. Deiters; neither
did he live to look upon a single printed page in the language in
which he had written that portion of the work published in his
lifetime. It was left for another hand to prepare the English
edition of an American writer’s history of Germany’s greatest
tone-poet, and to write its concluding chapters, as he believes,
in the spirit of the original author.</p>

<p>Under these circumstances there can be no vainglory in asserting
that the appearance of this edition of Thayer’s Life of
Beethoven deserves to be set down as a significant occurrence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[vii]</a></span>
in musical history. In it is told for the first time in the language
of the great biographer the true story of the man Beethoven&mdash;his
history stripped of the silly sentimental romance with which
early writers and their later imitators and copyists invested it so
thickly that the real humanity, the humanliness, of the composer
has never been presented to the world. In this biography there
appears the veritable Beethoven set down in his true environment
of men and things&mdash;the man as he actually was, the man as
he himself, like Cromwell, asked to be shown for the information
of posterity. It is doubtful if any other great man’s history
has been so encrusted with fiction as Beethoven’s. Except
Thayer’s, no biography of him has been written which presents
him in his true light. The majority of the books which have
been written of late years repeat many of the errors and falsehoods
made current in the first books which were written about
him. A great many of these errors and falsehoods are in the
account of the composer’s last sickness and death, and were either
inventions or exaggerations designed by their utterers to add
pathos to a narrative which in unadorned truth is a hundredfold
more pathetic than any tale of fiction could possibly be.
Other errors have concealed the truth in the story of Beethoven’s
guardianship of his nephew, his relations with his brothers, the
origin and nature of his fatal illness, his dealings with his publishers
and patrons, the generous attempt of the Philharmonic
Society of London to extend help to him when upon his deathbed.</p>

<p>In many details the story of Beethoven’s life as told here
will be new to English and American readers; in a few cases the
details will be new to the world, for the English edition of Thayer’s
biography is not a translation of the German work but a presentation
of the original manuscript, so far as the discoveries made
after the writing did not mar its integrity, supplemented by the
knowledge acquired since the publication of the first German
edition, and placed at the service of the present editor by the
German revisers of the second edition. The editor of this English
edition was not only in communication with Mr. Thayer during
the last ten years of his life, but was also associated to some extent
with his continuator and translator, Dr. Deiters. Not only
the fruits of the labors of the German editors but the original manuscript
of Thayer and the mass of material which he accumulated
came into the hands of this writer, and they form the foundation
on which the English “Thayer’s Beethoven” rests. The work
is a vastly different one from that which Thayer dreamed of when
he first conceived the idea of bringing order and consistency into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
the fragmentary and highly colored accounts of the composer’s
life upon which he fed his mind and fancy as a student at
college; but it is, even in that part of the story which he did not
write, true to the conception of what Beethoven’s biography
should be. Knowledge of the composer’s life has greatly increased
since the time when Thayer set out upon his task. The
first publication of some of the results of his investigations in
his “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Chronologisches Verzeichniss</span>” in 1865, and the first volume
of the biography which appeared a year later, stirred the critical
historians into activity throughout Europe. For them he had
opened up a hundred avenues of research, pointed out a hundred
subjects for special study. At once collectors of autographs
brought forth their treasures, old men opened up the books of
their memories, librarians gave eager searchers access to their
shelves, churches produced their archives, and hieroglyphic
sketches which had been scattered all over Europe were deciphered
by scholars and yielded up chronological information of inestimable
value. To all these activities Thayer had pointed the way,
and thus a great mass of facts was added to the already great
mass which Thayer had accumulated. Nor did Thayer’s labors
in the field end with the first publication of his volumes. So long
as he lived he gathered, ordered and sifted the new material
which came under his observation and prepared it for incorporation
into later editions and later volumes. After he was dead
his editors continued the work.</p>

<p>Alexander Wheelock Thayer was born in South Natick,
Massachusetts, on October 22nd, 1817, and received a liberal
education at Harvard College, whence he was graduated in 1843.
He probably felt that he was cut out for a literary career, for his
first work after graduation was done in the library of his <i>Alma
Mater</i>. There interest in the life of Beethoven took hold of him.
With the plan in his mind of writing an account of that life on
the basis of Schindler’s biography as paraphrased by Moscheles,
and bringing its statements and those contained in the “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Biographische
Notizen</span>” of Wegeler and Ries and a few English accounts
into harmony, he went to Europe in 1849 and spent two years
in making researches in Bonn, Berlin, Prague and Vienna. He
then returned to America and in 1852 became attached to the
editorial staff of “The New York Tribune.” It was in a double
sense an attachment; illness compelled him to abandon journalism
and sever his connection with the newspaper within two years,
but he never gave up his interest in it. He read it until the day
of his death, and his acquaintance with the member of the Tribune’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[ix]</a></span>
staff who was destined to have a part in the completion of his
lifework began when, a little more than a generation after he
had gone to Europe for the second time, he opened a correspondence
with him on a topic suggested by one of this writer’s criticisms.
In 1854 he went to Europe again, still fired with the ambition
to rid the life-history of Beethoven of the defects which
marred it as told in the current books. Schindler had sold the
<i>memorabilia</i> which he had received from Beethoven and Beethoven’s
friend Stephan von Breuning to the Prussian Government,
and the precious documents were safely housed in the
Royal Library at Berlin. It was probably in studying them
that Thayer realized fully that it was necessary to do more than
rectify and harmonize current accounts of Beethoven’s life if it
were correctly to be told. He had already unearthed much
precious ore at Bonn, but he lacked the money which alone would
enable him to do the long and large work which now loomed before
him. In 1856 he again came back to America and sought employment,
finding it this time in South Orange, New Jersey,
where Lowell Mason employed him to catalogue his musical
library. Meanwhile Dr. Mason had become interested in his
great project, and Mrs. Mehetabel Adams, of Cambridge, Massachusetts,
also. Together they provided the funds which enabled
him again to go to Europe, where he now took up a permanent
residence. At first he spent his time in research-travels, visiting
Berlin, Bonn, Cologne, Düsseldorf (where he found material of
great value in the archives of the old Electoral Courts of Bonn
and Cologne), Frankfort, Paris, Linz, Graz, Salzburg, London
and Vienna. To support himself he took a small post in the
Legation of the United States at Vienna, but exchanged this
after a space for the U. S. Consulship at Trieste, to which office
he was appointed by President Lincoln on the recommendation
of Senator Sumner. In Trieste he remained till his death, although
out of office after October 1st, 1882. To Sir George
Grove he wrote under date June 1st, 1895: “I was compelled to
resign my office because of utter inability longer to continue
Beethoven work and official labor together.” From Trieste,
when his duties permitted, he went out on occasional exploring
tours, and there he weighed his accumulations of evidence and
wrote his volumes.</p>

<p>In his travels Thayer visited every person of importance
then living who had been in any way associated with Beethoven
or had personal recollection of him&mdash;Schindler, the composer’s
factotum and biographer; Anselm Hüttenbrenner, in whose arms<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span>
he died; Caroline van Beethoven, widow of Nephew Karl; Charles
Neate and Cipriani Potter, the English musicians who had been
his pupils; Sir George Smart, who had visited him to learn the
proper interpretation of the Ninth Symphony; Moscheles, who
had been a professional associate in Vienna; Otto Jahn, who had
undertaken a like task with his own, but abandoned it and turned
over his gathered material to him; Mähler, an artist who had
painted Beethoven’s portrait; Gerhard von Breuning, son of
Beethoven’s most intimate friend, who as a lad of fourteen had
been a cheery companion of the great man when he lay upon his
fatal bed of sickness;&mdash;with all these and many others he talked,
carefully recording their testimony in his note-books and piling
up information with which to test the correctness of traditions
and printed accounts and to amplify the veracious story of Beethoven’s
life. His industry, zeal, keen power of analysis, candor
and fairmindedness won the confidence and help of all with whom
he came in contact except the literary charlatans whose romances
he was bent on destroying in the interest of the verities of history.
The Royal Library at Berlin sent the books in which many of
Beethoven’s visitors had written down their part of the conversations
which the composer could not hear, to him at Trieste so
that he might transcribe and study them at his leisure.</p>

<p>In 1865, Thayer was ready with the manuscript for Volume I
of the work, which contained a sketch of the Courts of the Electors
of Cologne at Cologne and Bonn for over a century, told of the
music cultivated at them and recorded the ancestry of Beethoven
so far as it had been discovered. It also carried the history of
the composer down to the year 1796. In Bonn, Thayer had made
the acquaintance of Dr. Hermann Deiters, Court Councillor and
enthusiastic musical littérateur, and to him he confided the task
of editing and revising his manuscript and translating it into
German. The reason which Thayer gave for not at once publishing
his work in English was that he was unable to oversee the
printing in his native land, where, moreover, it was not the custom
to publish such works serially. He urged upon his collaborator
that he practise literalness of translation in respect of his own
utterances, but gave him full liberty to proceed according to his
judgment in the presentation of documentary evidence. All
of the material in the volume except the draughts from Wegeler,
Ries and Schindler, with which he was frequently in conflict,
was original discovery, the result of the labors begun in Bonn in
1849. His principles he set forth in these words: “I fight for no
theories, and cherish no prejudices; my sole point of view is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[xi]</a></span>
truth.... I have resisted the temptation to discuss the
character of his (Beethoven’s) works and to make such a discussion
the foundation of historical speculation, preferring to leave such
matters to those who have a greater predilection for them. It
appears to me that Beethoven the <i>composer</i> is amply known
through his works and in this assumption the long and wearisome
labors of so many years were devoted to Beethoven the <i>man</i>.”
The plan to publish his work in German enabled Thayer to turn
over all his documentary evidence to Deiters in its original shape,
a circumstance which saved him great labor, but left it for his
American editor and continuator. The first German volume
appeared in 1866; its stimulative effect upon musical Europe has
been indicated. Volume II came from the press in 1872, Volume
III in 1879, both translated and annotated by Deiters. They
brought the story of Beethoven’s life down to the end of the
year 1816, leaving a little more than a decade still to be discussed.</p>

<p>The health of Thayer had never been robust, and the long
and unintermittent application to the work of gathering and
weighing evidence had greatly taxed his brain. He became subject
to severe headaches and after the appearance of the third
volume he found it impossible to apply himself for even a short
time to work upon the biography. In July, 1890, he wrote a
letter to Sir George Grove which the latter forwarded to this
writer. In it he tells in words of pathetic gratitude of the unexpected
honors showered upon him at Bonn when at the invitation
of the Beethoven-Haus Verein he attended the exhibition and
festival given in Beethoven’s birthplace a short time before.
Then he proceeds: “Of course the great question was on the lips
of all: When will the fourth volume appear? I could only say:
When the condition of my head allows it. No one could see or
have from my general appearance the least suspicion that I was
not in mental equal to my physical vigor. In fact, the extreme
excitement of these three weeks took off for the time twenty years
of my age and made me young again; but afterwards in Hamburg
and in Berlin the reaction came. Spite of the delightful musical
parties at Joachim’s, Hausmann’s, Mendelssohn’s ... my
head broke down more and more, and since my return hither,
July 3rd, has as yet shown small signs of recuperation. The
extreme importance of working out my fourth volume is more
than ever impressed upon my mind and weighs upon me like an
incubus. But as yet it is still utterly impossible for me to really
work. Of course I only live for that great purpose and do not
despair. My general health is such that I think the brain must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[xii]</a></span>
in time recover something of its vigor and power of labor. What
astonishes me and almost creates envy is to see this wonderful
power of labor as exemplified by you and my neighbor, Burton.
But from boyhood I have had head troubles, and what I went
through with for thirty years in supporting myself and working
on Beethoven is not to be described and excites my wonder that
I did not succumb. Well, I will not yet despair.” Thayer’s
mind, active enough in some things, refused to occupy itself with
the Beethoven material; it needed distraction, and to give it that
he turned to literary work of another character. He wrote a book
against the Baconian authorship of Shakespeare’s works; another
on the Hebrews in Egypt and their Exodus (which Mr. E. S.
Willcox, a friend of many years, published at his request in Peoria,
Illinois). He also wrote essays and children’s tales. Such
writing he could do and also attend to his consular duties; but an
hour or two of thought devoted to Beethoven, as he said in a
letter to the present writer, brought on a racking headache and
unfitted him for labor of any kind.</p>

<p>Meanwhile year after year passed by and the final volume of
the biography was no nearer its completion than in 1880. In fact,
beyond the selection and ordination of its material, it was scarcely
begun. His friends and the lovers of Beethoven the world over
grew seriously concerned at the prospect that it would never be
completed. Sharing in this concern, the editor of the present
edition developed a plan which he thought would enable Thayer
to complete the work notwithstanding the disabilities under
which he was laboring. He asked the coöperation of Novello,
Ewer &amp; Co., of London, and got them to promise to send a capable
person to Trieste to act as a sort of literary secretary to
Thayer. It was thought that, having all the material for the concluding
volume on hand chronologically arranged, he might talk
it over with the secretary, but without giving care to the manner
of literary presentation. The secretary was then to give the
material a proper setting and submit it to Thayer for leisurely
revision. Very hopefully, and with feelings of deep gratitude to
his friends, the English publishers, the American editor submitted
his plan; but Thayer would have none of it. Though unable to
work upon the biography for an hour continuously, he yet clung
to the notion that some day he would not only finish it but also
rewrite the whole for English and American readers. From one
of the letters placed at my disposal by Sir George Grove, it appears
that subsequently (in 1892) there was some correspondence between
an English publisher and Mr. Thayer touching an English<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[xiii]</a></span>
edition. The letter was written to Sir George on June 1st, 1895.
In it he says: “I then hoped to be able to revise and prepare it
(the Beethoven MS.) for publication myself, and was able to begin
the labor and arrange with a typewriting woman to make the
clean copy. How sadly I failed I wrote you. Since that time
the subject has not been renewed between us. I am now compelled
to relinquish all hope of ever being able to do the work.
There are two great difficulties to be overcome: the one is that
all letters and citations are in the original German as they were
sent to Dr. Deiters; the other, there is much to be condensed, as
I always intended should be for this reason: From the very first
chapter to the end of Vol. III, I am continually in conflict with
all previous writers and was compelled, therefore, to show in my
text that I was right by so using my materials that the reader
should be taken along step by step and compelled to see the truth
for himself. Had all my arguments been given in notes nine
readers out of ten would hardly have read them, and I should have
been involved in numberless and endless controversies. Now
the case is changed. A. W. T’s novelties are now, with few if
any exceptions, accepted as facts and can, in the English edition,
be used as such. Besides this, there is much new matter to be
inserted and some corrections to be made from the appendices
of the three German volumes. The prospect now is that I may
be able to do some of this work, or, at all events, go through my
MS. page by page and do much to facilitate its preparation for
publication in English. I have no expectation of ever receiving
any pecuniary recompense for my 40 years of labor, for my many
years of poverty arising from the costs of my extensive researches,
for my&mdash;but enough of this also.” In explanation of the final
sentence in this letter it may be added that Thayer told the present
writer that he had never received a penny from his publisher for
the three German volumes; nothing more, in fact, than a few
books which he had ordered and for which the publisher made no
charge.</p>

<p>Thus matters rested when Thayer died on July 15th, 1897.
The thought that the fruits of his labor and great sacrifices should
be lost to the world even in part was intolerable. Dr. Deiters,
with undiminished zeal and enthusiasm, announced his willingness
to revise the three published volumes for a second edition
and write the concluding volume. Meanwhile all of Thayer’s
papers had been sent to Mrs. Jabez Fox of Cambridge, Massachusetts,
the author’s niece and one of his heirs. There was a large
mass of material, and it became necessary to sift it in order that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[xiv]</a></span>
all that was needful for the work of revision and completion might
be placed in the hands of Dr. Deiters. This work was done, at
Mrs. Fox’s request, by the present writer, who, also at Mrs. Fox’s
request, undertook the task of preparing this English edition.
Dr. Deiters accomplished the work of revising Volume I, which
was published by Weber, the original publisher of the German
volumes, in 1891. He then decided that before taking up the
revision of Volumes II and III he would bring the biography to a
conclusion. He wrote, not the one volume which Thayer had
hoped would suffice him, but two volumes, the mass of material
bearing on the last decade of Beethoven’s life having grown so
large that it could not conveniently be comprehended in a single
tome, especially since Dr. Deiters had determined to incorporate
critical discussions of the composer’s principal works in the new
edition. The advance sheets of Volume IV were in Dr. Deiters’s
hands when, full of years and honors, he died on May 1st, 1907.
Breitkopf and Härtel had meanwhile purchased the German
copyright from Weber, and they chose Dr. Hugo Riemann to
complete the work of revision. Under Dr. Riemann’s supervision
Volumes IV and V were brought out in 1908, and Volumes II and
III in 1910-1911.</p>

<p>Not until this had been accomplished could the American
collaborator go systematically to work on his difficult and voluminous
task, for he had determined to use as much as possible of
Thayer’s original manuscript and adhere to Thayer’s original
purpose and that expressed in his letter to Sir George Grove. He
also thought it wise to condense the work so as to bring it within
three volumes and to seek to enhance its readableness in other ways.
To this end he abolished the many appendices which swell the
German volumes, and put their significant portions into the body
of the narrative; he omitted many of the hundreds of foot-notes,
especially the references to the works of the earlier biographers,
believing that the special student would easily find the sources
if he wished to do so, and the general reader would not care to
verify the statements of one who has been accepted as the court of
last resort in all matters of fact pertaining to Beethoven, the man;
he also omitted many letters and presented the substance of others
in his own words for the reason that they can all be consulted in the
special volumes which contain the composer’s correspondence; of
the letters and other documents used in the pages which follow,
he made translations for the sake of accuracy as well as to avoid
conflict with the copyright privileges of the publishers of English
versions. Being as free as the German editors in respect of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[xv]</a></span>
portion of the biography which did not come directly from the
pen of Thayer, the editor of this English edition chose his own
method of presentation touching the story of the last decade of
Beethoven’s life, keeping in view the greater clearness and rapidity
of narrative which, he believed, would result from a grouping
of material different from that followed by the German editors in
their adherence to the strict chronological method established by
Thayer.</p>

<p>A large number of variations from the text of the original
German edition are explained in the body of this work or in foot-notes.
In cases where the German editors were found to be in
disagreement with the English manuscript in matters of opinion
merely, the editor has chosen to let Mr. Thayer’s arguments stand,
though, as a rule, he has noted the adverse opinions of the German
revisers also. A prominent instance of this kind is presented by
the mysterious love-letter found secreted in Beethoven’s desk
after his death. Though a considerable literature has grown up
around the “Immortal Beloved” since Thayer advanced the hypothesis
that the lady was the Countess Therese Brunswick, the
question touching her identity and the dates of the letters is
still as much an open one as it was when Thayer, in his characteristic
manner, subjected it to examination. This editor has,
therefore, permitted Thayer not only to present his case in his
own words, but helped him by bringing his scattered pleadings
and briefs into sequence. He has also outlined in part the discussion
which followed the promulgation of Thayer’s theory, and
advanced a few fugitive reflections of his own. The related incident
of Beethoven’s vain matrimonial project has been put into
a different category by new evidence which came to light while
Dr. Riemann was engaged in his revisory work. It became necessary,
therefore, that the date of that incident be changed from
1807, where Thayer had put it, to 1810. By this important
change Beethoven’s relations to Therese Malfatti were made to
take on a more serious attitude than Thayer was willing to accord
them.</p>

<p>In this edition, finally, more importance is attached to the
so-called Fischer Manuscript than Thayer was inclined to give it,
although he, somewhat grudgingly we fear, consented that Dr.
Deiters should print it with critical comments in the Appendix of
his Vol. I. The manuscript, though known to Thayer, had come to
the attention of Dr. Deiters too late for use in the narrative portion
of the volume, though it was thus used in the second edition.
The story of the manuscript, which is now preserved in the museum<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[xvi]</a></span>
of the Beethoven-Haus Verein in Bonn, is a curious one. Its author
was Gottfried Fischer, whose ancestors for four generations had
lived in the house in the Rheingasse which only a few years ago
was still, though mendaciously, pointed out to strangers as the
house in which Beethoven was born. Fischer, who lived till
1864, was born in the house which formerly stood on the site of
the present building known as No. 934, ten years after Beethoven’s
eyes opened to the light in the Bonngasse. At the time of Fischer’s
birth the Beethoven family occupied a portion of the house and
Fischer’s father and the composer’s father were friends and companions.
There, too, had lived the composer’s grandfather. Gottfried
Fischer had a sister, Cäcilia Fischer, who was born eight
years before Beethoven; she remained unmarried and lived to be
85 years old, dying on May 23rd, 1845. The festivities attending
the unveiling of the Beethoven monument in 1838 brought many
visitors to Bonn and a natural curiosity concerning the relics of
the composer. Inquirers were referred to the house in the Rheingasse,
then supposed to be the birthplace of the composer, where
the Fischers, brother and sister, still lived. They told their story
and were urged by eager listeners to put it into writing. This Gottfried
did the same year, but, keeping the manuscript in hand, he
added to it at intervals down to the year 1857 at least. He came to
attach great value to his revelations and as time went on embellished
his recital with a mass of notes, many of no value, many
consisting of iterations and reiterations of incidents already recorded,
and also with excerpts from books to which, in his simplicity,
he thought that nobody but himself had access. He was
an uneducated man, ignorant even of the correct use of the German
language; it is, therefore, not surprising that much of his record is
utterly worthless; but mixed with the dross there is much precious
metal, especially in the spinster’s recollection of the composer’s
father and grandfather, for while Gottfried grew senile his sister
remained mentally vigorous to the end. Thayer examined the
document and offered to buy it, but was dissuaded by the seemingly
exorbitant price which the old man set upon it. It was
finally purchased for the city’s archives by the Oberbürgermeister
and thus came to the notice of Dr. Deiters. His use of it has been
followed by the present editor.</p>

<h3><i>Postscript</i></h3>

<p>The breaking out, in August, 1914, of the war between Austria
and Servia which eventually involved nearly all the civilized
nations of the world, led the publishers, who had originally undertaken
to print this Work as brought to a conclusion by the American
Editor, indefinitely to postpone its publication. In the spring
of 1920 the Beethoven Association, composed of musicians of
high rank, who had given a remarkably successful series of concerts
of Beethoven’s chamber-music in New York in the season
1919-20, at the suggestion of O. G. Sonneck and Harold Bauer
resolved to devote the proceeds of the concerts to promoting
the publication of Thayer’s biography. To this act of artistic
philanthropy the appearance of the work is due.</p>

<p>One of the compensations for the horrors of the French
Revolution was the sweeping away of many of the petty
sovereignties into which Germany was divided, thereby
rendering in our day a union of the German People and the rise
of a German Nation possible. The first to fall were the numerous
ecclesiastical-civil members of the old, loose confederation, some of
which had played no ignoble nor unimportant part in the advance of
civilization; but their day was past. The people of these states had
in divers respects enjoyed a better lot than those who were subjects
of hereditary rulers, and the old German saying: “It is good
to dwell under the crook,” had a basis of fact. At the least, they
were not sold as mercenary troops; their blood was not shed on
foreign fields to support their princes’ ostentatious splendor, to
enable mistresses and ill-begotten children to live in luxury and
riot. But the antiquated ideas to which the ecclesiastical rulers
held with bigoted tenacity had become a barrier to progress, the
exceptions being too few to render their farther existence desirable.
These members of the empire, greatly differing in extent, population,
wealth and political influence, were ruled with few or no
exceptions by men who owed their positions to election by
chapters or other church corporations, whose numbers were so
limited as to give full play to every sort of intrigue; but they
could not assume their functions until their titles were confirmed
by the Pope as head of the church, and by the Emperor as head
of the confederation. Thus the subject had no voice in the
matter, and it hardly need be said that his welfare and prosperity
were never included among the motives and considerations on
which the elections turned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span></p>

<p>The sees, by their charters and statutes, we think without
exception, were bestowed upon men of noble birth. They were
benefices and sinecures for younger sons of princely houses;
estates set apart and consecrated to the use, emolument and enjoyment
of German John Lacklands. In the long list of their
incumbents, a name here and there appears, that calls up historic
associations;&mdash;a man of letters who aided in the increase or
diffusion of the cumbrous learning of his time; a warrior who exchanged
his robes for a coat of mail; a politician who played a
part more or less honorable or the reverse in the affairs and intrigues
of the empire, and, very rarely, one whose daily walk and
conversation reflected, in some measure, the life and principles
of the founder of Christianity. In general, as they owed their
places wholly to political and family influences, so they assumed
the vows and garb of churchmen as necessary steps to the enjoyment
of lives of affluence and pleasure. So late as far into the
eighteenth century, travelling was slow, laborious and expensive.
Hence, save for the few more wealthy and powerful, journeys,
at long intervals, to a council, an imperial coronation or a diet
of the empire, were the rare interruptions to the monotony of
their daily existence. Not having the power to transmit their
sees to their children, these ecclesiastics had the less inducement
to rule with an eye to the welfare of their subjects: on the other
hand, the temptation was very strong to augment their revenues
for the benefit of relatives and dependents, and especially for the
gratification of their own tastes and inclinations, among which
the love of splendor and ostentatious display was a fruitful source
of waste and extravagance.</p>

<p>Confined so largely to their own small capitals, with little
intercourse except with their immediate neighbors, they were
far more dependent upon their own resources for amusement
than the hereditary princes: and what so obvious, so easily obtained
and so satisfactory as music, the theatre and the dance!
Thus every little court became a conservatory of these arts, and
for generations most of the great names in them may be found
recorded in the court calendars. One is therefore not surprised
to learn how many of the more distinguished musical composers
began life as singing boys in cathedral choirs of England and Germany.
The secular princes, especially those of high rank, had,
besides their civil administration, the stirring events of war,
questions of public policy, schemes and intrigues for the advancement
of family interests and the like, to engage their attention;
but the ecclesiastic, leaving the civil administration, as a rule,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
in the hands of ministers, had little to occupy him officially but
a tedious routine of religious forms and ceremonies; to him therefore
the theatre, and music for the mass, the opera, the ball-room,
and the salon, were matters of great moment&mdash;they filled a wide
void and were cherished accordingly.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Cologne and Its Electors</span></div>

<p>The three German ecclesiastical princes who possessed the
greatest power and influence were the Archbishops of Mayence,
Trèves and Cologne&mdash;Electors of the Empire and rulers of the
fairest regions of the Rhine. Peace appears hardly to have been
known between the city of Cologne and its earlier archbishops;
and, in the thirteenth century, a long-continued and even bloody
quarrel resulted in the victory of the city. It remained a free
imperial town. The archbishops retained no civil or political
power within its walls, not even the right to remain there more
than three days at any one time. Thus it happened, that in the
year 1257 Archbishop Engelbert selected Bonn for his residence,
and formally made it the capital of the electorate, as it remained
until elector and court were swept away in 1794.</p>

<p>Of the last four Electors of Cologne, the first was Joseph
Clemens, a Bavarian prince, nephew of his predecessor Maximilian
Heinrich. The choice of the chapter by a vote of thirteen to nine
had been Cardinal Fürstenberg; but his known, or supposed, devotion
to the interests of the French king had prevented the ratification
of the election by either the Emperor or the Pope. A
new one being ordered, resulted in favor of the Bavarian, then a
youth of eighteen years. The Pope had ratified his election and
appointed a bishop to perform his ecclesiastical functions <i>ad interim</i>,
and the Emperor invested him with the electoral dignity
December 1, 1689. Vehse says of him:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Like two of his predecessors he was the incumbent of five sees; he
was Archbishop of Cologne, Bishop of Hildesheim, Liège, Ratisbon and
Freisingen. His love for pomp and splendor was a passion which he
gratified in the magnificence of his court. He delighted to draw thither
beautiful and intellectual women. Madame de Raysbeck, and Countess
Fugger, wife of his chief equerry, were his declared favorites. For seventeen
years, that is, until the disastrous year 1706, when Fénelon consecrated
him, he delayed assuming his vows. He held the opinion, universal
in the courts of those days, that he might with a clear conscience enjoy
life after the manner of secular princes. In pleasing the ladies, he was
utterly regardless of expense, and for their amusement gave magnificent
balls, splendid masquerades, musical and dramatic entertainments, and
hunting parties.</p></div>

<p>St. Simon relates that several years of his exile were passed
at Valenciennes, where, though a fugitive, he followed the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
round of costly pleasures and amusements. He also records one
of the Elector’s jests which in effrontery surpasses anything related
of his contemporary, Dean Swift. Some time after his consecration,
he caused public notice to be given, that on the approaching
first of April he would preach. At the appointed time he
mounted the pulpit, bowed gravely, made the sign of the cross,
shouted “Zum April!” (April fool!), and retired amid a flourish of
trumpets and the rolling of drums.</p>

<p>Dr. Ennen labors energetically to prove that Joseph Clemens’s
fondness in later years for joining in all grand church ceremonies
rested upon higher motives than the mere pleasure of displaying
himself in his magnificent robes; and affirms that after assuming
his priestly vows he led a life devoted to the church and worthy
of his order; thenceforth never seeing Madame de Raysbeck,
mother of his illegitimate children, except in the presence of a
third person. It seems proper to say this much concerning a
prince whose electorship is the point of departure for notices of
music and musicians in Bonn during the eighteenth century; a
prince whose fondness for the art led him at home and in exile to
support both vocal and instrumental bands on a scale generous
for that age; and who, moreover, made some pretensions to the
title of composer himself, as we learn from a letter which under
date of July 20, 1720, he wrote to a court councillor Rauch to
accompany eleven of his motets. It is an amusingly frank letter,
beginning with a confession that he was an <i>Ignorant</i> who knew
nothing about notes and had absolutely no knowledge of <i>musique</i>,
wherefore he admits that his manner of composing is “very odd,”
being compelled to sing anything that came into his head to a
composer whose duty it was to bring the ideas to paper. Nevertheless
he is quite satisfied with himself, “At all events I must
have a good ear and <i>gusto</i>, for the public that has heard has always
approved. But the <i>methodum</i> which I have adopted is that of
the bees that draw and collect the honey from the sweetest flowers;
so, also, I have taken all that I have composed from good masters
whose <i>Musikalien</i> pleased me. Thus I freely confess my pilfering,
which others deny and try to appropriate what they have taken
from others. Let no one, therefore, get angry if he hears old
arias in it, for, as they are beautiful, the old is not deprived of its
praise.... I ascribe everything to the grace of God who
enlightened me, the unknowing, to do these things.” Not all
“composers,” royal or mean, are as honest as the old Elector!</p>

<p>It is fortunate for the present purpose, that the portion of
the electoral archives discovered after a lapse of nearly seventy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
years and now preserved at Düsseldorf, consists so largely of
documents relating to the musical establishment of the court at
Bonn during the last century of its existence. They rarely afford
information upon the character of the music performed, but are
sufficiently complete, when supplemented by the annual Court
Calendars, to determine with reasonable correctness the number,
character, position and condition of its members. The few petitions
and decrees hereafter to be given in full because of their
connection with the Beethovens, suffice for specimens of the long
series of similar documents, uniform in character and generally
of too little interest to be worth transcription.</p>

<p>In 1695 a decree issued at Liège by Joseph Clemens, then in
that city as titular bishop, though not consecrated, adds three new
names to the “Hoff-Musici,” one of which, Van den Eeden, constantly
reappears in the documents and calendars down to the year
1782. From a list of payments at Liège in the second quarter of
1696, we find that Henri Vandeneden (Heinrich Van den Eeden)
was a bass singer, and that the aggregate of vocalists, instrumentists,
with the organ-blower (<i>calcant</i>), was eighteen persons.</p>

<p>Returned to Bonn, Joseph Clemens resumed his plan of improving
his music, and for those days of small orchestras and
niggardly salaries he set it upon a rather generous foundation.
A decree of April 1, 1698, put in force the next month, names 22
persons with salaries aggregating 8,890 florins.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Political Vicissitudes of the Electorate</span></div>

<p>After the death of Maximilian Heinrich the government
passed into the hands of Cardinal Fürstenberg, his coadjutor,
who owed the position to the intrigues of Louis XIV, and now
used it by all possible means to promote French interests. The
king’s troops under French commanders, he admitted into the
principal towns of the electorate, and, for his own protection, a
French garrison of 10,000 men into Bonn. War was the consequence;
an imperial army successfully invaded the province,
and, advancing to the capital, subjected its unfortunate inhabitants
to all the horrors of a relentless siege, that ended October
15, 1689, in the expulsion of the garrison, now reduced to some 3900
men, of whom 1500 were invalids. Yet in the war of the Spanish
Succession which opened in 1701, notwithstanding the terrible
lesson taught only eleven years before, the infatuated Joseph
Clemens embraced the party of Louis. Emperor Leopold treated
him with singular mildness, in vain. The Elector persisted. In
1702 he was therefore excluded from the civil government and
fled from Bonn, the ecclesiastical authority in Cologne being empowered
by the Emperor to rule in his stead. The next year, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
great success of the French armies against the allies was celebrated
by Joseph Clemens with all pomp in Namur, where he then was;
but his triumph was short. John Churchill, then Earl of Marlborough,
took the field as commander-in-chief of the armies of
the allies. His foresight, energy and astonishing skill in action
justified Addison’s simile&mdash;whether sublime or only pompous&mdash;of
the angel riding in the whirlwind and directing the storm. He
was soon at Cologne, whence he despatched Cochorn to besiege
Bonn. That great general executed his task with such skill and
impetuosity, that on May 15 (1703) all was ready for storming
the city, when d’Allègre, the French commander, offered to
capitulate, and on the 19th was allowed to retire. “Now was
Bonn for the third time wrested from the hands of the French and
restored to the archbishopric, but alas, in a condition that aroused
indignation, grief and compassion on all sides,” says Müller.</p>

<p>Leopold was still kindly disposed toward Joseph Clemens,
but he died May 5, 1705, and his successor, Joseph I, immediately
declared him under the ban of the Empire. This deprived
him of the means and opportunities, as Elector, for indulging his
passion for pomp and display, while his neglect hitherto, under
dispensations from the Pope, to take the vows necessary to the
performance of ecclesiastical functions, was likewise fatal to that
indulgence as archbishop. But this could be remedied; Fénelon,
the famous Archbishop of Cambray, ordained him subdeacon
August 15, 1706; the Bishop of Tournay made him deacon
December 8, and priest on the 25th; on January 1, 1707, he read
his first mass at Lille, and indulged his passion for parade to the
full, as a pamphlet describing the incident, and silver and copper
medals commemorating it, still evince. “Two years later, May 1,
1709, Joseph Clemens received from Fénelon in Ryssel (Lille)
episcopal consecration and the pallium.”&mdash;(Müller.) Upon the
victory of Oudenarde by Marlborough, and the fall of Lille, he
took refuge in Mons. The treaty of Rastadt, March, 1714,
restored him to his electoral dignities and he returned to the Rhine;
but Dutch troops continued to hold Bonn until December 11,
1715. On the morning of that day they evacuated the city and
in the afternoon the Elector entered in a grand, solemn procession
commemorated by an issue of silver medals.</p>

<p>During all these vicissitudes Joseph Clemens, from whatever
source he derived the means, did not suffer his music to deteriorate
and, returned to Bonn, no sooner was the public business regulated
and restored to its former routine than he again turned his attention
to its improvement.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>

<p>Joseph Clemens died November 12, 1723, having previously
secured the succession to his nephew Clemens August, last of the
five Electors of Cologne of the Bavarian line. The new incumbent,
third son of Maximilian Emanuel, Elector of Bavaria and
his second wife, a daughter of the celebrated John Sobieski of
Poland, was born August 17, 1700, at Brussels, where his father
resided at the time as Governor General. From his fourth to his
fifteenth year he had been held in captivity by the Austrians at
Klagenfurt and Gratz; then, having been destined for the church,
he spent several years at study in Rome. As a child in 1715 he
had been appointed coadjutor to the Bishop of Regensburg; in 1719
he was elected to the two sees of Paderborn and Münster made
vacant by the death of his brother Moritz, was chosen coadjutor
to his uncle of Cologne in 1722, made his solemn entry into Bonn
as elector May 15, 1724, was the same year also elected Bishop
of Hildesheim, in 1725 Provost of the Cathedral at Liège, 1728
Bishop of Osnabrück, and, finally, in 1732 reached the dignity of
Grand Master of the Teutonic Order.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">The Rule of Elector Clemens August</span></div>

<p>His rule is distinguished in the annals of the electorate for
little else than the building, repairing, renewing and embellishing
of palaces, hunting-seats, churches, convents, and other edifices.
At Bonn he erected the huge pile the foundation of which had
been laid by his uncle, now the seat of the university. The handsome
City Hall was also his work; the villa at Poppelsdorf was
enlarged by him into a small palace, Clemensruhe, now the University
Museum of Natural History. In Brühl, the Augustusburg,
now a Prussian royal palace, dates from his reign, and Münster,
Mergentheim, Arnsberg and other places show similar monuments
of his prodigality in the indulgence of his taste for splendor.
“Monstrous were the sums,” says Dr. Ennen, “squandered by him
in the purchase of splendid ornaments, magnificent equipages,
furniture costly for its variety, and of curious works of art; upon
festivities, sleighing-parties, masquerades, operas, dramas and
ballets; upon charlatans, swindlers, female vocalists, actors and
dancers. His theatre and opera alone cost him 50,000 thalers
annually and the magnificence of his masked balls, twice a week
in winter, is proof sufficient that no small sums were lavished
upon them.”</p>

<p>The aggregate of the revenues derived from the several states
of which Clemens August was the head nowhere appears; but
the civil income of the electorate alone had, in his later years,
risen from the million of florins of his predecessor to about the
same number of thalers&mdash;an increase of some 40 per centum;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
added to this were large sums derived from the church, and subsidies
from Austria, France and the sea-coast states amounting
to at least 14,000,000 francs; indeed, during the Elector’s last
ten years the French subsidies alone made an aggregate of at
least 7,300,000 francs; in 1728 Holland paid on account of the
Clemens Canal 76,000 thalers. At the centennial opening of
the strong-box of the Teutonic Order he obtained the fat accumulations
of a hundred years; and 25 years later he opened it again.
Yet, though during his rule peace was hardly interrupted in his
part of Europe, he plunged ever deeper and more inextricably
into debt, leaving one of large proportions as his legacy to his successor.
He was a bad ruler, but a kindly, amiable and popular
man. How should he know or feel the value of money or the
necessity of prudence? His childhood had been spent in captivity,
his student years in Rome, where, precisely at that period,
poetry and music were cultivated, if not in very noble and manly
forms, at least with a Medicean splendor. The society of the
Arcadians was in full activity. True, both Clemens August and
his brother were under the age which enabled them to be enrolled
as “Shepherds,” and consequently their names appear neither in
Crescembini nor in Quadrio; but it is not to be supposed that two
young princes, already bishops by election and certain of still higher
dignities in the future, were excluded from the palaces of Ruspoli
and Ottoboni, from those brilliant literary, artistic and luxurious
circles in which, only half a dozen years before, their young
countryman, the musician Handel, had found so cordial a welcome.
Those were very expensive tastes, as the citation from
Ennen shows, which the future elector brought with him from
Rome. Italian palaces, Italian villas, churches, gardens, music,
songstresses, mistresses, an Italian holy staircase on the Kreuzberg
(leading to nothing); Italian pictures, mosaics and, what not?
All these things cost money&mdash;but must he not have them?</p>

<p>This elector is perhaps the only archbishop on record to
whose epitaph may truthfully be added: “He danced out of this
world into some other”;&mdash;which happened in this wise: Having,
in the winter of 1760-61, by some unexpected stroke of good fortune,
succeeded in obtaining from the usually prudent and careful
bankers of Holland a loan of 80,000 thalers, he embraced the
opportunity of making a long-desired visit to his family in Munich.
Owing to a sudden attack of illness he was once on the point of
turning back soon after leaving Bonn. He persevered, however,
reached Coblenz and crossed over to the palace of the Elector
of Trèves at Ehrenbreitstein, where he arrived at 4 <span class="smcap">p.m.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></span>
February 5, 1761. At dinner an hour later he was unable to eat;
but at the ball, which followed, he could not resist the fascination
of the Baroness von Waldendorf&mdash;sister of His Transparency of
Trèves&mdash;and danced with her “eight or nine turns.” Of course
he could not refuse a similar compliment to several other ladies.
The physical exertion of dancing, joined to the excitement of the
occasion and following a dreary winter-day’s journey, was too
much for the enfeebled constitution of a man of sixty years. He
fainted in the ballroom, was carried to his chamber and died
next day.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Appointments in the Electoral Chapel</span></div>

<p>It seems to have been the etiquette, that when an elector
breathed his last, the musical chapel expired with him. At all
events, no other explanation appears of the fact that so many of
the petitions for membership, which are still preserved, should be
signed by men who had already been named in the Court Calendars.
It is also to be remarked that some of the petitioners receive
appointments “without salary.” These seem to have been
appointments of the kind, which in later years were distinguished
in the records and in the calendars by the term “accessist,” and
which, according to the best lights afforded by the archives, may
be considered as having been provisional, until the incumbent
had proved his skill and capacity, or until a vacancy occurred
through the death or resignation of some old member. There are
indications that the “accessists,” though without fixed salary,
received some small remuneration for their services; but this is by
no means certain. It would seem that both vocalists and instrumentists
who received salaries out of the state revenues were
limited to a fixed number; that the amount of funds devoted to
this object was also strictly limited and the costs incurred by the
engagement of superior artists with extra salaries, or by an increase
of the number, were defrayed from the Elector’s privy
purse; that the position of “accessist” was sought by young musicians
as a stepping-stone to some future vacancy which, when
acquired, insured a gradually increasing income during the years
of service and a small pension when superannuated; that the
etiquette of the court demanded, even in cases when the Elector
expressly called some distinguished artist to Bonn, that the appointment
should be apparently only in gracious answer to an
humble petition, and that, with few exceptions, both singers and
members of the orchestra were employed in the church, the theatre
and the concert-room.</p>

<p>Clemens August made his formal entry into Bonn, May 15,
1724. A number of petitions are passed over, but one granted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
“without salary” on February 18, 1727, from Van den Eeden
must be given in its entirety:</p>

<p>On the same date Van den Eeden received his appointment
as second court organist. June 8, 1728, a decree is issued granting
him a salary of 100 florins. To a third petition the next year,
signed Van den Enden, the answer is an increase of his salary to
200 thalers, and thus a future instructor of Ludwig van Beethoven
becomes established in Bonn. The records need not concern
us now until we reach the following, which forms part of the
history of the grandfather of the subject of this biography:</p>

<p>On May 2, 1747, Johann Ries became Court Trumpeter
with a salary of 192 thalers. This is the first representative we
have met of a name which afterwards rose to great distinction,
not only in the orchestra of the Elector but also in the world at
large. On March 5, 1754, he was formally appointed Court
Musician (violinist) having set forth in his petition that instead
of confining himself to the trumpet he had made himself serviceable
in the chapel by singing and playing other instruments.
Later he took ill and was sent to Cologne. We shall presently
meet his two daughters and his son Franz Ries, the last of whom
will figure prominently in the life-history of Beethoven. Under
date March 27, 1756, occur several papers which have a double
interest. They relate to the Beethoven family and are so complete
as to exhibit the entire process of appointment to membership
in the electoral chapel. The original documents are not
calculated to give the reader a very exalted idea of the orthographical
knowledge of the petitioner or the Chamber Music
Director Gottwaldt; but that fault gives us the clue to the correct
pronunciation of the name Beethoven&mdash;the English “Beet-garden.”</p>

<p>But slender success has rewarded the search for means of
determining the character and quality of that opera and music,
upon which, according to Ennen, Clemens August lavished such
large sums. The period embraced in that elector’s rule (1724-1761)
was precisely that in which the <i>old</i> Italian opera, the oratorio
and the sacred cantata reached their extreme limits of development
through the genius of Handel and J. S. Bach. It closes at
the moment when Gluck, C. P. E. Bach and Joseph Haydn were
laying the immovable foundations of a new operatic, orchestral
and pianoforte music, and before the perfected sonata-form, that
found universal adoption in all compositions of the better class,
not vocal. Little music comparatively was issued from the press
in those days, and consequently new forms and new styles made
their way slowly into vogue. Another consequence was that the
offices of composer for the chamber, the church, the comedy,
or however they were named, were by no means sinecures&mdash;neither
at the imperial court of Maria Theresia, nor at the court of any
petty prince or noble whose servants formed his orchestra. Composers
had to furnish music on demand and as often as was necessary,
as the hunter delivered game or the fisherman fish. What
a volume of music was produced in this manner can be seen in
the case of Joseph Haydn at Esterhaz, whose fruitfulness did not, in
all probability, exceed that of many another of his contemporaries.
The older Telemann furnished compositions to the courts of
Bayreuth and Eisenach as well as the Gray Friars at Frankfort-on-the-Main,
and also performed his duties as musical director
and composer at Hamburg. He wrote music with such ease that,
as Handel said, he could write for eight voices as rapidly as an
ordinary man could write a letter. Under such conditions did
the men write who are mentioned as official composers in our
narrative. It is probable that not a note of theirs remains in
existence, and equally probable that the loss is not at all deplorable
except as it leaves the curiosity of an antiquary unsatisfied.
A few text-books to vocal pieces performed on various occasions
during this reign have been preserved, their titles being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
“Componimento per Musica,” music by Giuseppe dall’Abaco,
Director of the Chamber Music (1740); “La Morte d’Abel” (no
date is given, but “il Signor Biethoven” sang the part of <i>Adamo</i>);
“Esther” (“From the Italian of S. F. A. Aubert,” the text partly

<p>After the unlucky ball at Ehrenbreitstein the crook and
sceptre of Cologne passed from the Bavarian family which had
so long held them into the hands of Maximilian Friedrich of the
Suabian line Königsegg- (or Königseck-) Rothenfels. For a century
or more this house had enjoyed fat livings in the church at
Cologne, in which city the new elector was born on May 13, 1708.
He was the fourth of his race who had held the important office of
Dean of the Cathedral, from which post he was elevated to the
electorship on April 6, 1761, and to the ecclesiastical principality
of Münster the next year; with which two sees he was fain to be
content. He was by nature an easy, good-tempered, indolent,
friendly man, of no great force of character&mdash;qualities which in
the incumbent of a rich sinecure just completing his fifty-third
year, would be too fully confirmed and developed by habit to
change with any change of circumstances; and which, says
Stramberg, made him unusually popular throughout the land
despite the familiar little verse:</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem" lang="de" xml:lang="de"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Bei Clemens August trug man blau und weiss,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Da lebte man wie im Paradeis;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bei Max Friedrich trug man sich schwarz und roth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Da litt man Hunger wie die schwere Noth.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>The condition of the finances had become such through the
extravagant expenditures of Clemens August that very energetic
measures were necessary, and to the effects of these, during the
first few years of Max Friedrich’s rule, in throwing many persons
out of employment, these doggerel lines doubtless owe their origin.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Max Friedrich and His Minister</span></div>

<p>It was fortunate for the Elector’s subjects that his indolence
was made good by the activity and energy of a prime minister
who found his beau ideal of a statesman in Frederick II of Prussia,
whom, in his domestic policy, he imitated as far as the character
of the two governments allowed. This was equally if not more
true in the principality of Münster. To the respect which one
must feel for the memory of Belderbusch, the all-powerful minister
at Bonn, is added, in the case of Fürstenberg, the equally powerful
minister at Münster, admiration and regard for the man.
The former was respected, feared, but not loved in the electorate;
the latter was respected and very popular in the principality.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
To Kasper Anton von Belderbusch the new Elector owed his elevation;
to his care he entrusted the state; to his skill and strength
of character he was indebted for release from the pecuniary difficulties
which beset him and for the satisfaction, as the years
rolled by, of seeing his states numbered among the most prosperous
and flourishing in Germany. Belderbusch’s first care was
to reduce the expenditure. “He put a stop to building,” says
Ennen, “dismissed a number of the actors, restricted the number
of concerts and court balls, dispensed with the costly hunts,
reduced the salaries of court officials, officers and domestics,
lessened the <i>état</i> for the kitchen, cellar and table of the prince,
turned the property left by Clemens August into money and comforted
the latter’s creditors with the hope of better times.” But
though economy was the rule, still, where the Elector considered
it due to his position, he could be lavish. Whatever opinions may
be entertained as to the wisdom and expediency of clothing ecclesiastics
with civil power, it would be unjust not to give the bright
as well as the dark side of the picture. This is well put by Kaspar
Risbeck in relation to the Rhenish states whose princes were
churchmen, and his remarks are in place here, since they relate
in part to that in which the childhood and youth of Beethoven
were spent.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The whole stretch of the country from here to Mayence is one of
the richest and most populous in Germany. Within this territory of
18 German miles there are 20 cities lying hard by the shore of the Rhine
and dating, for the greater part, from the period of the Romans. It is still
plainly to be seen that this portion of Germany was the first to be built
up. Neither morasses nor heaths interrupt the evidences of cultivation
which stretch with equal industry far from the shores of the river
over the contiguous country. While many cities and castles built under
Charlemagne and his successors, especially Henry I, in other parts of
Germany have fallen into decay, all in this section have not only been
preserved but many have been added to them.... The natural
wealth of the soil in comparison with that of other lands, and the easy
disposition of its products by means of the Rhine, have no doubt contributed
most to these results. Nevertheless, great as is the prejudice
in Germany against the ecclesiastical governments, they have beyond
doubt aided in the blooming development of these regions. In the
three ecclesiastical electorates which make up the greater part of this
tract of land nothing is known of those tax burdens under which the
subjects of so many secular princes of Germany groan. These princes
have exceeded the old assessments but slightly. Little is known in
their countries of serfdom. The appanage of many princes and princesses
do not force them to extortion. They have no inordinate military
institution, and do not sell the sons of their farmers; and they have never
taken so active a part in the domestic and foreign wars of Germany as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
the secular princes. Though they are not adept in encouraging their
subjects in art culture, varied agriculture has been developed to a high
degree of perfection throughout the region. Nature does of its own
accord what laws and regulations seek to compel, as soon as the rocks
of offence are removed from the path.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p></div>

<p>Henry Swinburne, whose letters to his brother were published
long after his death under the title of “The Courts of Europe,”
writes under date of November 29, 1780:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Bonn is a pretty town, neatly built, and its streets tolerably well
paved, all in black lava. It is situated in a flat near the river. The
Elector of Cologne’s palace faces the South entry. It has no beauty
of architecture and is all plain white without any pretensions.</p>

<p>We went to court and were invited to dine with the Elector (Königsegge).
He is 73 years old, a little, hale, black man, very merry and
affable. His table is none of the best; no dessert wines handed about,
nor any foreign wines at all. He is easy and agreeable, having lived
all his life in ladies’ company, which he is said to have liked better than
his breviary. The captains of his guard and a few other people of the
court form the company, amongst whom were his two great-nieces,
Madame de Hatzfeld and Madame de Taxis. The palace is of immense
size, the ball-room particularly large and low.... The Elector goes
about to all the assemblies and plays at Tric-trac. He asked me to be
of his party but I was not acquainted with their way of playing. There
is every evening an assembly or play at court. The Elector seems very
strong and healthy, and will, I think, hold the Archduke a good tug yet.</p></div>

<p>This Archduke was Max Franz, youngest son of Maria
Theresia, whose acquaintance Swinburne had made in Vienna,
and who had just been chosen coadjutor to Max Friedrich. A
curious proof of the liberality, not to say laxity, of the Elector’s
sentiments in one direction is given by Stramberg in his “Rheinischer
Antiquarius,” to wit, the possession of a mistress in common
by him and his minister Belderbusch&mdash;the latter fathering the
children&mdash;and this mistress was the Countess Caroline von
Satzenhofen, Abbess of Vilich!</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Chapelmaster Ludwig van Beethoven</span></div>

<p>The reduction which was made by Belderbusch upon the
accession of Max Friedrich in the expenses of the theatre and
other amusements does not appear, except in the case of the chapelmaster,
to have extended to the court music proper, nor to have
been long continued in respect to the “operetta and comedy.”
The first in order of the documents and notices discovered relating
to the musical establishment of this Elector are of no common
interest, being the petition of a candidate for the vacant office of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>

They are as follows:</p>

<p>May it please Your Electoral Grace to permit a representation of

<p>About December, 1763, a singer, Madame Lentner, after
some four and a half years of service, threw up her appointment,
giving occasion, through the vacancy thus caused, for the following
petition, report and decrees:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="salut">

Most Reverend Elector, Most Gracious<br />

</p>

<p>Will Your Electoral Grace deign to receive the representation that
by the acceptance of service elsewhere of Court Musician Dauber there
has fallen to the disposition of Your Reverend Electoral Grace a salary
of 1,050 rth., wherefore I, Joannes van Beethoven, having graciously
been permitted for a considerable time to serve as court musician and
have been graciously assured by decree of appointment to the first
vacancy, and have always faithfully and diligently performed my duties
and graciously been permitted to be in good voice, therefore my prayer is
made to Your Reverend and Electoral Grace for a grant of the aforesaid

<p>Your Electoral Grace having graciously been pleased to submit for

<p>Humbly obeying Your gracious command I submit an impartial
report that for about a year the daughter of the court musician Ries
has frequented the “Duc sahl” (doxal) and sung the soprano part and
that to my satisfaction.</p>

<p>But now that my son Joannes van Beethoven has already for 13
years sung soprano, contralto and tenor in every emergency that has
arisen on the “Duc sahl,” is also capable on the violin, wherefore Your

<p>May Your Most Reverend Electoral Grace, graciously permit the

salary of 100 th. graciously allowed me, I pray Your Electoral Grace

thrown into constant contact with those whose names will appear.
Some of these names will come up many years later in Vienna;
others will have their parts to play in the narrative of that child’s
life. Omitting, for the present, a petition of Johann van Beethoven,
we begin them with that of Joseph Demmer, of date January
23, 1773, which first secured him his appointment after a year’s

<p>The search for means to form some correct idea of the character
of the musical performances at the Elector’s court during
this reign has been more successful than for the preceding; but
much is left to be desired down to the year 1778, when the theatre
was placed upon a different basis and its history is sufficiently
recorded. Such notices, however, in relation to the operatic entertainments
as have been found scattered, mostly in the newspapers
of Bonn, in those years, are numerous enough to give an idea of
their character; while the remarks upon the festivities of the
court, connected with them, afford a pretty lively picture of social
amusement in the highest circle. We make room for some of the

<p>There are three more operettas which evidently belong to
the succeeding winter when the Bonn company had the aid of
two singers from the electoral court of Trèves. Their titles are
“L’Improvvisata, o sia la Galanteria disturbata,” by Lucchesi, “Li
tre Amanti ridicoli,” by Galuppi, and “La Moda,” by Baroni.
Ludwig van Beethoven did not sing in them. The means are still
wanting to fill up the many gaps in the annals of this period or to
carry them on during the next three years. Perhaps, however, the
loss is not of much importance, for the materials collected are
sufficient to warrant certain conclusions in regard to the general
character of the court music. The musicians, both vocal and
instrumental, were employed in the church, concert-room and
theatre; their number remained without material change from
the days of Christopher Petz to the close of Chapelmaster van
Beethoven’s life; places in this service were held to be a sort of
heritage, and of right due to the children of old incumbents, when
possessed of sufficient musical talent and knowledge; few if any
names of distinguished virtuosos are found in the lists of the members,
and, in all probability, the performances never rose above
the respectable mediocrity of a small band used to playing
together in the light and pleasing music of the day.</p>

<p>The dramatic performances appear to have been confined to
the operetta; and the vocalists, who sang the Latin of the mass,
seem to have been required to be equally at home in German,
Italian and French in the theatre. Two visits of the Angelo
Mingotti troupe are noted; and one attempt, at least, to place
the opera upon a higher basis by the engagement of Italian songstresses,
was evidently made in the time of Clemens August.;
it may be concluded that no great improvement was made&mdash;it is
certain that no permanent one was; for in the other case the Bonn
theatrical revolution of 1778 had not been needed. This must be
noticed in detail.</p>

<p>Chronologically the following sketch belongs to the biography
of Ludwig van Beethoven, as it embraces a period which happens
in his case to be of special interest, young as he was;&mdash;the period
from his 8th to his 14th year. But the details given, though of
great importance for the light which they throw upon the musical
life in which he moved and acted, would hardly be of so much
interest to most readers as to justify breaking with them the course
of the future narrative.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>It was a period of great awakening in theatrical matters.
Princes and courts were beginning everywhere in Germany to
patronize the drama of their mother tongue and the labors of
Lessing, Gotter and other well-known names, in the original production
of German, or in the translation of the best English,
Italian and French plays, were justifying and giving ever new
impulse to the change in taste. From the many itinerant troupes
of players performing in booths, or, in the larger cities, in the
play-houses, the better class of actors were slowly finding their
way into permanent companies engaged and supported by the
governments. True, many of the newly established court theatres
had but a short and not always a very merry life; true, also, that
the more common plan was merely to afford aid and protection to
some itinerant troupe; still the idea of a permanent national
theatre on the footing of the already long-existing court musical
establishments had made way, and had already been carried out in
various places before it was taken up by the elector at Bonn. It
can hardly be supposed that the example of the imperial court at
Vienna, with the immense means at its disposal, could exert any
direct influence upon the small court at Bonn at the other extremity
of Germany; but what the Duke of Gotha and the elector at
Mannheim had undertaken in this direction, Max Friedrich may
well have ventured and determined to imitate. But there was
an example nearer home&mdash;in fact in his own capital of Münster,
where he, the prince primate, usually spent the summer. In
1775, Dobbler’s troupe, which had been for some time playing
in that city, was broken up.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The Westhus brothers in Münster built up their own out of the
ruins; but it endured only a short time. Thereupon, under the care of
the minister, H. von Fürstenberg (one of those rare men whom heaven
elects and equips with all necessary gifts to cultivate what is good and
beautiful in the arts), a meeting of the lovers of the stage was arranged
in May and a few gentlemen of the nobility and a few from the parterre
formed a council which assumed the direction. The Elector makes a
considerable contribution. The money otherwise received is to be
applied to the improvement of the wardrobe and the theatre. The
actors receive their honoraria every month.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p></div>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Opera and Drama at Bonn in 1779</span></div>

<p>At Easter, 1777, Seyler, a manager famous in German theatrical
annals, and then at Dresden, finding himself unable to compete
with his rival, Bondini, left that city with his company to
try his fortunes in Frankfort-on-the-Main, Mayence, and other
cities in that quarter. The company was very large&mdash;the Theatre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
Lexicon (Article “Mainz”) makes it, including its orchestra,
amount to 230 individuals!&mdash;much too large, it seems, in spite of
the assertion of the Theatre Lexicon, to be profitable. Be that
as it may, after an experience of a year or more, two of the leading
members, Grossmann and Helmuth, accepted an engagement
from Max Friedrich to form and manage a company at Bonn in
order that “the German art of acting might be raised to a school
of morals and manners for his people.” Taking with them a
pretty large portion of Seyler’s company, including several of
the best members, the managers reached Bonn and were ready
upon the Elector’s return from Münster to open a season. “The
opening of the theatre took place,” says the Bonn “Dramaturgische
Nachrichten,” “on the 26th of November, 1778, with a
prologue spoken by Madame Grossmann, ‘Wilhelmine Blondheim,’
tragedy in three acts by Grossmann, and ‘Die grosse Batterie,’
comedy in one act by Ayrenhofer.” The same authority gives
a list of all the performances of the season, which extended to the
30th of May, 1779, together with débuts, the dismissals and other
matters pertaining to the actors. The number of the evenings
on which the theatre was open was 50. A five-act play, as a rule,
occupied the whole performance, but of shorter pieces usually
two were given; and thus an opening was found occasionally for an
operetta. Of musical dramas only seven came upon the stage and
these somewhat of the lightest order except the first&mdash;the melodrama
“Ariadne auf Naxos,” music by Benda. The others were:</p>

<table>
<tr>
<td valign="top">
<p>

1779.</p>
</td><td>
<p>February 21. “Julie,” translated from the French by Grossmann,
music by Desaides.</p>

<p>February 28. “Die Jäger und das Waldmädchen,” operetta in one
act, music by Duni.</p>

<p>March 21. “Der Hofschmied,” in two acts, music by Philidor.</p>

<p>April 9. “Röschen und Colas,” in one act, music by Monsigny.</p>

<p>May 5. “Der Fassbinder,” in one act, music by Oudinot.</p>

<p>May 14. A prologue “Dedicated to the Birthday Festivities
of His Electoral Grace of Cologne, May 13, 1779, by J. A.
Freyherrn vom Hagen.”</p>
</td></tr></table>

<p>The selection of dramas was, on the whole, very creditable to
the taste of the managers. Five of Lessing’s works, among them
“Minna von Barnhelm” and “Emilia Galotti,” are in the list and
some of the best productions of Bock, Gotter, Engel and their
contemporaries; of translations there were Colman’s “Clandestine
Marriage” and “Jealous Wife,” Garrick’s “Miss in her Teens,”
Cumberland’s “West Indian,” Hoadly’s “Suspicious Husband,”
Voltaire’s “Zaire” and “Jeannette,” Beaumarchais’s “Eugénie,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
two or three of the works of Molière, and Goldoni, etc.;&mdash;in short,
the list presents much variety and excellence.</p>

<p>Max Friedrich was evidently pleased with the company, for
the “Nachrichten” has the following in the catalogue of performances:
“On the 8th (of April) His Electoral Grace was pleased to
give a splendid breakfast to the entire company in the theatre....
The company will occupy itself until the return of His Electoral
Grace from Münster, which will be in the middle of November,
with learning the newest and best pieces, among which are ‘Hamlet,’
‘King Lear’ and ‘Macbeth,’ which are to be given also with
much splendor of costume according to the designs of famous
artists.”</p>

<p>It may be remarked here that the “Bonn Comedy House”
(for painting the interior of which Clemens August paid 468
thalers in 1751, a date which seems to fix the time at which that
end of the palace was completed), occupied that portion of the
present University Archæological Museum room next the Coblenz
Gate, with large doors opening from the stage into the passageway
so that this space could be used as an extension of the stage
in pieces requiring it for the production of grand scenic effects.
Above the theatre was the “Redouten-Saal” of Max Franz’s
time. The Elector had, of course, an entrance from the passages
of the palace into his box. The door for the public, in an angle
of the wall now built up, opened out upon the grove of horse-chestnuts.
The auditorium was necessarily low, but spacious
enough for several hundred spectators. Though much criticized
by travellers as being unworthy so elegant a court, not to say
shabby, it seems to have been a nice and snug little theatre.</p>

<p>Meanwhile affairs with Seyler were drawing to a crisis. He
had returned with his company from Mannheim and reopened at
Frankfort, August 3, 1779. On the evening of the 17th, to escape
imprisonment as a bankrupt, whether through his own fault or
that of another&mdash;the Theatre Lexicon affirms the latter case&mdash;he
took his wife and fled to Mayence. The company was allowed
by the magistrates to play a few weeks with a view of earning at
least the means of leaving the city; but on October 4, its members
began to separate; Benda and his wife went to Berlin, but C.
G. Neefe, the music director, and Opitz, descended the Rhine
to Bonn and joined the company there&mdash;Neefe assuming temporarily
the direction of the music in the theatre&mdash;of which more in
another place.</p>

<p>No record has been found of the repertory of the Bonn
theatre for the season 1779-1780, except that the opening piece on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
December 3, on the evening after the Elector’s return from Münster,
was a prologue, “Wir haben Ihn wieder!” text by Baron vom
Hagen, with airs, recitatives and choruses composed by Neefe;
that the “Déserteur” was in the list, and finally Hiller’s “Jagd.”
In June, 1781, the season being over, the company migrated to
Pyrmont, from Pyrmont to Cassel, and thence, in October, back
to Bonn.</p>

<p>It does not follow, however, that all these operas, operettas
and plays with music were produced during the season in Bonn.
The company followed the Elector to Münster in June, 1782, and
removed thence to Frankfort-on-the-Main for its regular series
of performances at Michaelmas. It came back to Bonn in the
Autumn.</p>

<p>But a still farther provision has been made for the Elector’s
amusement during the season of 1783-’84, by the engagement of
a ballet corps of eighteen persons. The titles of five newly rehearsed
ballets are given in the report from which the above
particulars are taken, and which may be found in the theatrical
calendar for 1784.</p>

<p>With an enlarged company and a more extensive repertory,
preparations were made for opening the theatre upon the Elector’s
return, at the end of October, from Münster to Bonn. But the
relations of the company to the court have been changed. Let
the “Theater-Kalender” describe the new position in which the
stage at Bonn was placed:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Bonn. His Electoral Grace, by a special condescension, had graciously
determined to make the theatrical performances gratuitous and
to that end has closed a contract with His Highness’s Theatrical Director
Grossmann according to which besides the theatre free of rent, the illumination
and the orchestra he is to receive an annual subvention for the
maintenance of the company. On His Highness’s command there will
be two or three performances weekly. By particular grace the director
is permitted to spend several summer months in other places.</p></div>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">An Influence on the Boy Beethoven</span></div>

<p>The advantages of this plan for securing a good repertory,
a good company and a zealous striving for improvement are obvious;
and its practical working during this, its only, season, so
far as can now be gathered from scanty records, was a great success.
It will hereafter be seen that the boy Ludwig van Beethoven
was often employed at the pianoforte at the rehearsals&mdash;possibly
also at the performances of the company of which Neefe was the
musical director. That a company consisting almost exclusively
of performers who had passed the ordeal of frequent appearance
on the stage and had been selected with full knowledge of the
capacity of each, and which, moreover, had gained so much success
at the Bonn court as to be put upon a permanent footing, must
have been one of more than the ordinary, average excellence, at
least in light opera, needs no argument. Nor need comments
be made upon the influence which daily intercourse with it, and
sharing in its labors, especially in the direction of opera, must
have exerted upon the mind of a boy of twelve or thirteen years
possessed of real musical genius.</p>

<p>The theatrical season, and with it the company, came to an
untimely end. Belderbusch died in January, 1784. Madame
Grossmann died in childbed on March 28, and on April 15
the Elector followed them to another world. After the death
of the Elector Maximilian Friedrich the Court Theatre was closed
for the official mourning and the company dismissed with four
weeks’ salary.</p>

<p>It is consonant to the plan of this introductory chapter that
some space be devoted to sketches of some of the principal
men whose names have already occurred and to some notes upon
the musical amateurs of Bonn who are known, or may be supposed,
to have been friends of the boy Beethoven. These notices make
no claim to the credit of being the result of original research; they
are, except that of Neefe, little more than extracts from a letter,
dated March 2, 1783, written by Neefe and printed in Cramer’s
“Magazin der Musik” (Vol. I, pp. 337 <i>et seq.</i>). At that time the
“Capelldirector,” as Neefe calls him, was Cajetano Mattioli,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
born at Venice, August 7, 1750, whose appointments were concertmaster
and musical director in Bonn, made on May 26, 1774
and April 24, 1777.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>He studied in Parma, says Neefe, with the first violinist Angelo
Moriggi, a pupil of Tartini, and in Parma, Mantua and Bologna conducted
grand operas like “Orfeo,” “Alceste,” etc., by the Chevalier Gluck
with success. He owed much to the example set by Gluck in the matter
of conducting. It must be admitted that he is a man full of fire, of
lively temperament and fine feeling. He penetrates quickly into the
intentions of a composer and knows how to convey them promptly and
clearly to the entire orchestra. He was the first to introduce accentuation,
instrumental declamation, careful attention to forte and piano,
or all the degrees of light and shade in the orchestra of this place. In
none of the qualifications of a leader is he second to the famed Cannabich
of Mannheim. He surpasses him in musical enthusiasm, and, like him,
insists upon discipline and order. Through his efforts the musical repertory
of this court has been provided with a very considerable collection
of good and admirable compositions, symphonies, masses and other
works, to which he makes daily additions; in the same manner he is
continually striving for the betterment of the orchestra. Just now he
is engaged in a project for building a new organ for the court chapel.
The former organ, a magnificent instrument, became a prey of the flames
at the great conflagration in the palace in 1777. His salary is 1,000 fl.</p>

<p>The chapelmaster (appointed May 26, 1774) was Mr. Andrea
Lucchesi, born May 28, 1741, at Motta in Venetian territory. His teachers
in composition were, in the theatre style, Mr. Cocchi of Naples; in
the church style, Father Paolucci, a pupil of Padre Martini at Bologna,
and afterwards Mr. Seratelli, Chapelmaster of the Duke of Venice. He
is a good organist and occupied himself profitably with the instrument
in Italy. He came here with Mr. Mattioli as conductor of an Italian
opera company in 1771. Taken altogether he is a light, pleasing and
gay composer whose part-writing is cleaner than that of most of his
countrymen. In his church-works he does not confine himself to the
strict style affected by many to please amateurs. Neefe enumerates
Lucchesi’s compositions as follows: 9 works for the theatre, among
them the opera “L’Isola della Fortuna” (1765), “Il Marito geloso” (1766),
“Le Donne sempre Donne,” “Il Matrimonio per astuzia” (1771) for
Venice, and the two composed at Bonn, “Il Natal di Giove” and “L’inganno
scoperto,” various intermezzi and cantatas; various masses,
vespers and other compositions for the church; six sonatas for the pianoforte
and violin; a pianoforte trio, four pianoforte quartets and several
pianoforte concertos. His salary was 1,000 fl.</p></div>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Christian Gottlob Neefe’s Career</span></div>

<p>The organist of the Court Chapel was Christian Gottlob
Neefe, son of a poor tailor of Chemnitz in Saxony, where he was
born February 5, 1748. He is one of the many instances in musical
history in which the career of the man is determined by the beauty
of his voice in childhood. At a very early age he became a
chorister in the principal church, which position gave him the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
best school and musical instruction that the small city afforded&mdash;advantages
so wisely improved as to enable him in early youth
to gain a living by teaching. At the age of 21, with 20 thalers in
his pocket and a stipend of 30 thalers per annum from the magistrates
of Chemnitz, he removed to Leipsic to attend the lectures
of the university, and at that institution in the course of time he
passed his examination in jurisprudence. Upon this occasion he
argued the negative of the question: “Has a father the right to
disinherit a son for devoting himself to the theatre?” In Chemnitz
Neefe’s teachers in music had been men of small talents and
very limited acquirements, and even in Leipsic he owed more
to his persevering study of the theoretical works of Marpurg and
C. P. E. Bach than to any regular instructor. But there he had
the very great advantage of forming an intimate acquaintance
with, and becoming an object of special interest to, Johann Adam
Hiller, the celebrated director of the Gewandhaus Concerts, the
then popular and famous composer, the introducer of Handel’s
“Messiah” to the German public, the industrious writer upon
music, and finally a successor of Johann Sebastian Bach as Cantor
of the Thomas School. Hiller gave him every encouragement in
his power in his musical career; opened the columns of his musical
“<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Wöchentliche Nachrichten</span>” to his compositions and writings;
called him to his assistance in operatic composition; gave him
the results of his long experience in friendly advice; criticized his
compositions, and at length, in 1777, gave him his own position
as music director of Seyler’s theatrical company, then playing at
the Linkische Bad in Dresden. Upon the departure of that troupe
for Frankfort-on-the-Main, Neefe was persuaded to remain with
it in the same capacity. He thus became acquainted with Fräulein
Zinck, previously court singer at Gotha but now engaged for
Seyler’s opera. The acquaintance ripened into a mutual affection
and ended in marriage not long afterward. It is no slight
testimony to the high reputation which he enjoyed that at the
moment of Seyler’s flight from Frankfort (1779) Bondini, whose
success had driven that rival from Dresden, was in correspondence
with Neefe and making him proposals to resign his position under
Seyler for a similar but better one in his service. Pending the
result of these negotiations Neefe, taking his wife with him,
temporarily joined Grossmann and Helmuth at Bonn in the same
capacity. Those managers, who knew the value of his services
from their previous experience as members of the Seyler troupe,
paid a very strong, though involuntary, tribute to his talents and
personal character by adopting such unfair measures as to compel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
the musician to remain in Bonn until Bondini was forced to fill
his vacancy by another candidate. Having once got him, Grossmann
was determined to keep him&mdash;and succeeded.</p>

<p>As long as the Grossmann company remained undivided
Neefe accompanied it in its annual visits to Münster and other
places;&mdash;thus the sketch of his life printed sixteen years later in
the first volume of the “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Allgemeine Musikzeitung</span>” of Leipsic
bears date “Frankfort-on-the-Main, September 30, 1782”; but
from that period save, perhaps, for a short time in 1783, he seems
not to have left Bonn at all.</p>

<p>There were others besides Grossmann and Helmuth who
thought Neefe too valuable an acquisition to the musical circles
of Bonn not to be secured. Less than a year and a half after his
arrival there the minister Belderbusch and the countess Hatzfeld,
niece of the Elector, secured to him, though a Protestant, an
appointment to the place of court organist. The salary of 400
florins, together with the 700 florins from Grossmann, made his
income equal to that of the court chapelmaster. It is difficult
now to conceive of the forgotten name of C. G. Neefe as having
once stood high in the list of the first North German composers;
yet such was the case. Of Neefe’s published compositions, besides
the short vocal and clavier pieces in Hiller’s periodical, there
had already appeared operettas in vocal score, “Die Apotheke”
(1772), “Amor’s Guckkasten” (1772), “Die Einsprüche” (1773)
and “Heinrich und Lyda” (1777); also airs composed for Hiller’s
“Dorf-Barbier” and one from his own republished opera “Zemire
und Azor”; twelve odes of Klopstock&mdash;sharply criticized by
Forkel in his “Musikalisch-Kritische Bibliothek,” much to the
benefit of the second edition of them; and a pretty long series of
songs. Of instrumental music he had printed twenty-four sonatas
for pianoforte solo or with violin; and from Breitkopf and Härtel’s
catalogues, 1772 and 1774, may be added the following works
included neither in his own list nor that of Gerber: a partita for
string quartet, 2 horns, 2 oboes, 2 flutes and 2 bassoons; another
for the same instruments minus the flutes and bassoons; a third
for the string quartet and 2 oboes only, and two symphonies for
string quartet, 2 horns, 2 oboes and 2 flutes. The “Sophonisbe”
music was also finished and twenty years later, after Mozart had
given a new standard of criticism, it was warmly eulogized in the
“<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Allgemeine Musikzeitung</span>” of Leipsic. At the date of his letter
to Cramer (March 2, 1783) he had added to his published works
“Sechs Sonaten am Clavier zu singen,” “Vademecum für Liebhaber
des Gesangs und Clavier,” the clavier score of “Sophonisbe,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
and a concerto for clavier and orchestra. His manuscripts, he adds
(Cramer’s “Magazine,” I; p. 382), consist of (a) the scores of the
operettas which had appeared in pianoforte arrangements; (b) the
score of his opera “Zemire und Azor”; (c) the score of his opera
“Adelheit von Veltheim”; (d) the score of a bardic song for the
tragedy “The Romans in Germany”; (e) the scores of theatrical
between-acts music; (f) the score of a Latin “Pater noster”;
(g) various other smaller works. He had in hand the composition
of the operetta “Der neue Gutsherr,” the pianoforte score of
which, as also that of “Adelheit von Veltheim,” was about to be
published by Dyck in Leipsic. A year before at a concert for
amateurs at the house of Mr. von Mastiaux he had produced an
ode by Klopstock, “Dem Unendlichen,” for four chorus voices
and a large orchestra, which was afterwards performed in Holy
Week in the <i>Fräuleinstiftskirche</i>. In short, Neefe brought to
Bonn a high-sounding reputation, talent, skill and culture both
musical and literary, which made him invaluable to the managers
when new French and Italian operas were to be prepared for the
German stage; great facility in throwing off a new air, song,
<i>entr’acte</i> or what not to meet the exigencies of the moment; very
great industry, a <i>cacoethes scribendi</i> of the very highest value to
the student of Bonn’s musical history in his time and a new element
into the musical life there. This element may have seemed somewhat
formal and pedantic, but it was solid, for it was drawn from
the school of Handel and Bach.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Music in Private Houses of Bonn</span></div>

<p>Let us return to Neefe’s letter to Cramer again for some
notices of music outside the electoral palace:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Belderbusch, the minister, retained a quintet of wind-instruments,
2 clarinets, 2 horns and a bassoon.</p>

<p>The Countess von Belderbusch, wife of a nephew of the minister,
whose name will come up again, “plays skilfully upon the clavier.”</p>

<p>The Countess von Hatzfeld, niece of the Elector, was “trained in
singing and clavier playing by the best masters of Vienna to whom,
indeed, she does very much honor. She declaims recitatives admirably
and it is a pleasure to listen to her sing arias <i>di parlante</i>. She plays the
fortepiano brilliantly and in playing yields herself up completely to her
emotions, wherefore one never hears any restlessness or uneveness of
time in her <i>tempo rubato</i>. She is enthusiastically devoted to music
and musicians.”<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>Chancellor and Captain von Schall “plays clavier and violin.
Though not adept on either instrument he has very correct musical
feeling. He knows how to appreciate the true beauties of a composition,
and how to judge them, and has large historical and literary knowledge
of music.”</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
<p>Frau Court Councillor von Belzer “plays the clavier and sings. She
has a strong, masculine contralto of wide range, particularly downwards.”</p>

<p>Johann Gottfried von Mastiaux, of the Finance Department and
incumbent of divers high offices, is a self-taught musician. He plays
several instruments himself and has given his four sons and a daughter
the best musical instruction possible in Bonn. All are pianists and so
many of them performers on other instruments that the production of
quintets is a common family enjoyment. He is a devoted admirer of
Haydn, with whom he corresponds, and in his large collection of music
there are already 80 symphonies, 30 quartets and 40 trios by that master.
His rare and valuable instruments are so numerous “that he could almost
equip a complete orchestra. Every musician is his friend and welcome
to him.”</p>

<p>Count Altstädter: “in his house one may at times hear a very
good quartet.”</p>

<p>Captain Dantoine, “a passionate admirer and knower of music;
plays the violin and the clavier a little. He learned composition from
the books of Marpurg, Kirnberger and Riepel. Formed his taste in
Italy. In both respects the reading of scores by classical masters has
been of great service to him.” Among his compositions are several
operettas, symphonies and quartets “in Haydn’s style.”</p>

<p>The three Messrs. Facius, “sons of the Russian agent here, are
soundly musical; the two elder play the flute and the youngest plays
the violoncello.” (According to Fischer the members of this family
were visitors at the house of the Beethovens.)</p>

<p>There are many more music-lovers here, but the majority of them
are too much given to privacy, so far as their musical practice goes, to
be mentioned here. Enough has been said to show that a stranger
fond of music need never leave Bonn without nourishment. Nevertheless,
a large public concert institution under the patronage of His Electoral
Grace is still desirable. It would be one more ornament of the capital
and a promoter of the good cause of music.</p></div>

<p>What with the theatre, the court music, the musical productions
in the church and such opportunities in private it is
plain that young talent in those days in Bonn was in no danger of
starvation for want of what Neefe calls “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">musikalische Nahrung</span>.”</p>

<p>So much upon the <i>dramatis personæ</i>, other than the principal
figure and his family. Let an attempt follow to describe the
little city as it appeared in 1770&mdash;in other words, to picture the
scene. By an enumeration made in 1789, the population of
Bonn was 9,560 souls, a number which probably for a long series
of years had rarely varied beyond a few score, more or less&mdash;one,
therefore, that must very nearly represent the aggregate in 1770.
For the town had neither manufactures nor commerce beyond
what its own wants supported; it was simply the residence of the
Elector&mdash;the seat of the court, and the people depended more or
less directly upon that court for subsistence&mdash;as a wag expressed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
it, “all Bonn was fed from the Elector’s kitchen.” The old city
walls&mdash;(the “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">gar gute Fortification, dass der Churfürst sicher
genug darinnen Hof halten kann</span>” of Johann Hübner’s description)&mdash;were
already partially destroyed. Within them the whole
population seems to have lived. Outside the city gates it does
not appear that, save by a chapel or two, the eye was impeded
in its sweep across gardens and open fields to the surrounding
villages which, then as now hidden in clusters of walnut and
fruit trees, appeared, when looked upon from the neighboring
hills, like islands rising upon the level surface of the plain. The
great increase of wealth and population during the last 150 years
in all this part of the Rhine valley under the influence of the wise
national economy of the Prussian government, has produced
corresponding changes in and about the towns and villages; but
the grand features of the landscape are unchanged; the ruins
upon the Drachenfels and Godesberg looked down, as now, upon
the distant roofs and spires of Bonn; the castle of Siegburg rose
above the plains away to the East; the chapel crowned the Petersberg,
the church with the marble stairs the nearer Kreuzberg.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">A Prospect of Bonn in Beethoven’s Day</span></div>

<p>The fine landing place with its growing trees and seats for
idlers, the villas, hotels, coffee-houses and dwellings outside the
old walls, are all recent; but the huge ferryboat, the “flying
bridge,” even then was ever swinging like a pendulum from shore
to shore. Steam as a locomotive power was unknown, and the
commerce of the Rhine floated by the town, gliding down with
the current on rafts or in clumsy but rather picturesque boats,
or impelled against the stream by the winds, by horses and even
by men and women. The amount of traffic was not, however,
too great to be amply provided for in this manner; for population
was kept down by war, by the hard and rude life of the peasant
class, and by the influences of all the false national-economic
principles of that age, which restrained commerce by every device
that could be made to yield present profit to the rulers of the
Rhine lands. Passengers had, for generations, no longer been
plundered by mail-clad robbers dwelling upon a hundred picturesque
heights; but each petty state had gained from the Emperor’s
weakness “vested rights” in all sorts of custom-levies
and taxes. Risbeck (1780) found nine toll-stations between Mayence
and Coblenz; and thence to the boundary of Holland, he
declares there were at least sixteen, and that in the average each
must have collected 30,000 Rhenish florins per annum.</p>

<p>To the stranger, coming down from Mayence, with its narrow
dark lanes, or up from Cologne, whose confined and pestiferously<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
dirty streets, emitting unnamed stenches, were but typical of
the bigotry, superstition and moral filth of the population&mdash;all
now happily changed, thanks to a long period of French and
Prussian rule&mdash;little Bonn seemed a very picture of neatness
and comfort. Even its ecclesiastical life seemed of another order.
The men of high rank in the church were of high rank also by
birth; they were men of the world and gentlemen; their manners
were polished and their minds enlarged by intercourse with the
world and with gentlemen; they were tolerant in their opinions
and liberal in their views. Ecclesiastics of high and low degree
were met at every corner as in other cities of the Rhine
region; but absence of military men was a remarkable feature.
Johann Hübner gives the reason for this in few and quaint words:&mdash;“In
times of war much depends upon who is master of Bonn,
because traffic on the Rhine can be blockaded at this pass. Therefore
the place has its excellent fortification which enables the
Elector to hold his court in ample security within its walls. But
he need not maintain a garrison there in time of peace, and in time
of war troops are garrisoned who have taken the oath to the
Emperor and the empire. This was settled by the peace of
Ryswick as well as Rastatt.”</p>

<p>While the improvement in the appearance of the streets of
Bonn has necessarily been great, through the refitting or rebuilding
of a large portion of the dwelling-houses, the plan of the town,
except in those parts lying near the wall, has undergone no essential
change, the principal one being the open spaces, where in
1770 churches stood. On the small triangular Römer-Platz was
the principal parish church of Bonn, that of St. Remigius, standing
in such a position that its tall tower looked directly down the
Acherstrasse. In 1800 this tower was set on fire by lightning
and destroyed; six years later the church itself was demolished
by the French and its stones removed to become a part of the
fortifications at Wesel. On the small, round grass plot as one
goes from the Münster church toward the neighboring city gate
(Neuthor) stood another parish church&mdash;a rotunda in form&mdash;that
of St. Martin, which fell in 1812 and was removed; and at the
opposite end of the minster, separated from it only by a narrow
passage, was still a third, the small structure dedicated to St.
Gangolph. This, too, was pulled down in 1806. Only the fourth
parish church, that of St. Peter in Dietkirchen, is still in existence
and was, at a later date, considerably enlarged. After the demolition
of these buildings a new division of the town into parishes
was made (1806).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>The city front of the electoral palace, now the university,
was more imposing than now, and was adorned by a tall, handsome
tower containing a carillon, with bells numerous enough to
play, for instance, the overture to Monsigny’s “Deserter.” This
part of the palace, with the tower and chapel, was destroyed by
fire in 1777.</p>

<p>The town hall, erected by Clemens August, and the other
churches were as now, but the large edifice facing the university
library and museum of casts, now occupied by private dwellings
and shops, was then the cloister and church of the Franciscan
monks. A convent of Capuchin nuns stood upon the Kesselgasse;
its garden is now a bleaching ground.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Holiday Times in the Little City</span></div>

<p>Let the fancy picture, upon a fine Easter or Pentecost morning
in those years, the little city in its holiday attire and bustle. The
bells in palace and church tower ringing; the peasants in coarse
but picturesque garments, the women abounding in bright colors,
come in from the surrounding villages, fill the market-place and
crowd the churches at the early masses. The nobles and gentry&mdash;in
broad-flapped coats, wide waistcoats and knee-breeches,
the entire dress often of brilliant colored silks, satins and velvets,
huge, white, flowing neckcloths, ruffles over the hands, buckles
of silver or even of gold at the knees and upon the shoes, huge
wigs becurled and bepowdered on the heads, and surmounted by
the cocked hat, when not held under the arm, a sword at the side,
and commonly a gold-headed cane in the hand (and if the morning
be cold, a scarlet cloak thrown over the shoulders)&mdash;are daintily
picking their way to the palace to kiss His Transparency’s hand or
dashing up to the gates in heavy carriages with white wigged and
cocked-hatted coachmen and footmen. Their ladies wear long
and narrow bodices, but their robes flow with a mighty sweep;
their apparent stature is increased by very high-heeled shoes and
by piling up their hair on lofty cushions; their sleeves are short,
but long silk gloves cover the arms. The ecclesiastics, various in
name and costume, dress as now, save in the matter of the flowing
wig. The Elector’s company of guards is out and at intervals
the thunder of the artillery on the walls is heard. On all sides,
strong and brilliant contrasts of color meet the eye, velvet and
silk, purple and fine linen, gold and silver&mdash;such were the fashions
of the time&mdash;costly, inconvenient in form, but imposing, magnificent
and marking the differences of rank and class. Let the
imagination picture all this, and it will have a scene familiar to
the boy Beethoven, and one in which as he grew up to manhood
he had his own small part to play.</p>

<p>The Ancestral van Beethoven Family in Belgium&mdash;Removal

and Chapelmaster&mdash;Birth and Education of Johann
van Beethoven&mdash;The Parents of the Composer.</p></div>


<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">The Composer’s Belgian Ancestry</span></div>

<p>At the beginning of the seventeenth century a family named
van Beethoven lived in a village of Belgium near Louvain.
A member of it removed to and settled in Antwerp about
1650. A son of this Beethoven, named William, a wine dealer,
married, September 11, 1680, Catherine Grandjean and had issue,
eight children. One of them, baptized September 8, 1683, in the
parish of Notre Dame, now received the name Henry Adelard, his
sponsors being Henry van Beethoven, acting for Adelard de Redincq,
Baron de Rocquigny, and Jacqueline Grandjean. This Henry
Adelard Beethoven, having arrived at man’s estate, took to wife
Maria Catherine de Herdt, who bore him twelve children&mdash;the
third named Louis, the twelfth named Louis Joseph. The latter,
baptized December 9, 1728, married, November 3, 1773, Maria
Theresa Schuerweghs, and died November 11, 1808, at Oosterwyck.
The second daughter, named like her mother Maria
Theresa, married, September 6, 1808, Joseph Michael Jacobs and
became the mother of Jacob Jacobs, in the middle of the nineteenth
century a professor of painting in Antwerp, who supplied
in part the materials for these notices of the Antwerp Beethovens,
although the principal credit is due to M. Léon de Burbure of
that city.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>The certificate of baptism of Louis van Beethoven, third
son of Henry Adelard, is to this effect:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Antwerp, December 23, 1712&mdash;<i>Baptizatus</i>, Ludovicus.</p>

<p>Parents: Henricus van Beethoven and Maria Catherine de
Hert.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>Sponsors: Petrus Bellmaert and Dymphona van Beethoven.</p></div>

<p>It is a family tradition&mdash;Prof. Jacobs heard it from his mother&mdash;that
this Louis van Beethoven, owing to some domestic difficulties
(according to M. Burbure they were financial), secretly
left his father’s house at an early age and never saw it again,
although in later years an epistolary correspondence seems to
have been established between the fugitive and his parents.
Gifted with a good voice and well educated musically, he went
to Louvain and applied for a vacant position as tenor to the
chapter ad Sanctum Petrum, receiving it on November 2, 1731.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
A few days later the young man of 18 years was appointed substitute
for three months for the singing master (<i>Phonascus</i>), who
had fallen ill, as is attested by the minutes of the Chapter, under
date November 2, 1731.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>The young singer does not seem to have filled the place
beyond the prescribed time. By a decree of Elector Clemens
August, dated March, 1733 (the month of Joseph Haydn’s birth),
he became Court Musician in Bonn with a salary of 400 florins,
a large one for those days, particularly in the case of a young man
who only three months before had completed his 20th year.
Allowing the usual year of probation to which candidates for the
court chapel were subjected, Beethoven must have come to Bonn
in 1732. This corresponds to the time spent at Louvain as well
as to a petition of 1774, to be given hereafter, in which Johann
speaks of his father’s “42 years of service.” There is another
paper of date 1784 which makes the elder Beethoven to have
served about 46 years, but this is from another hand and of less
authority than that written by the son.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Other Beethoven Families in Bonn</span></div>

<p>What it was that persuaded Ludwig van Beethoven to go
to Bonn is unknown. Gottfried Fischer, who owned the house
in the Rheingasse in which two generations of Beethovens lived,
professed to know that Elector Clemens August learned to know
him as a good singer at Liège and for that reason called him to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
Bonn. That is not impossible, whether the Elector went to Louvain
or Ludwig introduced himself to him at Liège. But it is
significant that another branch of the Beethoven family was
already represented at Bonn. Michael van Beethoven was born
in Malines in February, 1684. He was a son of Cornelius van
Beethoven and Catherine Leempoel, and beyond doubt, as the
later associations in Bonn prove, closely related to the Antwerp
branch of the family. Michael van Beethoven married Maria
Ludovica Stuykers (or Stuykens) on October 8, 1707. His eldest
son also bore the name of Cornelius (born in September, 1708, in
Malines) and there were four other sons born to him during his stay
in Malines, among them two who were named Louis, up to 1715.
At a date which is uncertain, this family removed to Bonn. There
Cornelius, on February 20, 1734, married a widow named Helena
de la Porte (née Calem), in the church of St. Gangolph, Ludwig
van Beethoven, the young court singer, being one of the witnesses.
In August of the same year Cornelius was proxy for his father
(who, evidently, had not yet come to Bonn), as godfather for
Ludwig’s first child. Later, after his son had established a household,
he removed to Bonn, for Michael van Beethoven died in
June, 1749, in Bonn, and in December of the same year Maria
Ludovica Stuykens (<i>sic</i>), “the Widow van Beethoven.” Cornelius
became a citizen of Bonn on January 17, 1736, on the ground
that he had married the widow of a citizen, and in 1738 he stands
alone as representative of the name in the list of Bonn’s citizens.
He seems to have been a merchant, and is probably the man who
figures in the annual accounts of Clemens August as purveyor
of candles. He lost his wife, and for a second married Anna
Barbara Marx, <i>virgo</i>, on July 5, 1755, who bore him two daughters
(1756 and 1759), both of whom died young and for both of whom
Ludwig van Beethoven was sponsor. Cornelius died in 1764 and
his wife in 1765, and with this the Malines branch of the family
ended. Which one of the two cousins (for so we may in a general
way consider them) came to Bonn, Ludwig or Cornelius, must be
left to conjecture. There is evidence in favor of the former in
the circumstance that Cornelius does not appear as witness at
the marriage of Ludwig in 1733. If Ludwig was the earlier
arrival, then the story of his call by the Elector may be true; he
was not disappointed in his hope of being able to make his way
by reason of his knowledge of music and singing.</p>

<p>The next recorded fact in his history may be seen in the
ancient register of the parish of St. Remigius, now preserved in
the town hall of Bonn. It is the marriage on September 7, 1733,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
of Ludwig van Beethoven and Maria Josepha Poll, the husband
not yet 21 years of age, the wife 19. Then follows in the records
of baptisms in the parish:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="date">
1734, August 8.</p>
<table border="0" cellpadding="8" cellspacing="0" summary=""><tr><th>

Maria
Bernardina
Ludovica.</td><td>

Maria Bernardina Menz,<br />
Michael van Beethoven;<br />
in his place Cornelius van<br />
Beethoven.</td></tr></table></div>


<p>The child Bernardina died in infancy, October 17, 1735. Her
place was soon filled by a son, Marcus Josephus, baptized April
15, 1736, of whom the parents were doubtless early bereaved, for
no other notice whatever has been found of him. After the lapse
of some four years the childless pair again became parents, by
the birth of a son, whose baptismal record has not been discovered.
It is supposed that this child, Johann, was baptized in the Court
Chapel, the records of which are not preserved in the archives
of the town and seem to be lost; or that, possibly, he was born
while the mother was absent from Bonn. An official report upon
the condition and characters of the court musicians made in 1784,
however, gives Johann van Beethoven <i>born in Bonn</i> and aged
forty-four&mdash;thus fixing the date of his birth towards the end of
1739 or the beginning of 1740.</p>

<p>The gradual improvement of the elder Beethoven’s condition
in respect of both emolument and social position, is creditable to
him alike as a musician and as a man. Poorly as the musicians
were paid, he was able in his last years to save a small portion of
his earnings; his rise in social position is indicated in the public
records;&mdash;thus, the first child is recorded as the son of L. v. Beethoven
“musicus”; as sponsor to the eldest daughter of Cornelius
van Beethoven, he appears as “Dominus” van Beethoven;&mdash;to the
second as “Musicus Aulicus”; in 1761 he becomes “Herr Kapellmeister,”
and his name appears in the Court Calendar of the
same year, third in a list of twenty-eight “Hommes de chambre
honoraires.” Of the elder Beethoven’s appointment as head of
the court music no other particulars have been obtained than
those to be found in his petition and the accompanying decree
printed in Chapter I. From these papers it appears that the
bass singer has had the promise of the place from Clemens August
as successor to Zudoli, but that the Elector, when the vacancy
occurred, changed his mind and gave it to his favorite young<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
violinist Touchemoulin, who held the position for so short a time,
however, that his name never appears as chapelmaster in the
Court Calendar, he having resigned on account of the reduction
of his salary by Belderbusch, prime minister of the new Elector
who just at that period succeeded Clemens August. The elevation
of a singer to such a place was not a very uncommon event
in those days, but that a chapelmaster should still retain his
place as singer probably was. Hasse and Graun began their
careers as vocalists, but more to the point are the instances of
Steffani, Handel’s predecessor at the court of Hanover, and of
Righini, successively chapelmaster at Mayence and Berlin. In
all these cases the incumbents were distinguished and very successful
composers. Beethoven was not. Wegeler’s words, “the
chapelmaster and bass singer had at an earlier date produced
operas at the National Theatre established by the Elector,” have
been rather interpreted than quoted by Schindler and others
thus: “it is thought that under the luxury-loving Elector Clemens
August, he produced operas of his own composition”&mdash;a construction
which is clearly forced and incorrect. Strange that so
few writers can content themselves with exact citations! Not
only is there no proof whatever, certainly none yet made public,
that Chapelmaster van Beethoven was an author of operatic
works, but the words in his own petition, “inasmuch as the
Toxal must be sufficiently supplied with <i>musique</i>,” can hardly
be otherwise understood than as intended to meet a possible
objection to his appointment on the ground of his not being a
composer. Wegeler’s words, then, would simply mean that he
put upon the stage and conducted the operatic works produced,
which were neither numerous nor of a very high order during his
time. His labors were certainly onerous enough without adding
musical composition. The records of the electoral court which
have been described and in part reproduced in the preceding
chapter, exhibit him conducting the music of chapel, theatre and
“Toxal,” examining candidates for admission into the electoral
musical service, reporting upon questions referred to him by the
privy council and the like, and all this in addition to his services
as bass singer, a position which gave him the principal bass parts
and solos to sing both in chapel and theatre. Wegeler records
a tradition that in Gassmann’s operetta “L’Amore Artigiano”
and Monsigny’s “Déserteur” he was “admirable and received
the highest applause.” If this be true it proves no small degree
of enterprise on his part as chapelmaster and of well-conserved
powers as a singer; for these two operas were first produced, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
one in Vienna, the other in Paris, in 1769, when Beethoven had
already entered his fifty-eighth year.</p>

<p>The words of Demmer in his petition of January 23, 1773,
“the bass singer van Beethoven is incapacitated and can no longer
serve as such,” naturally suggest the thought that the old gentleman’s
appearance as <i>Brunoro</i> in Lucchesi’s “L’Inganno scoperto”
in May, 1773, was a final compliment to his master, the Elector,
upon his birthday. He did not live to celebrate another; the
death of “Ludwig van Beethoven, Hoffkapellmeister,” is recorded
at Bonn under date of December 24, 1773&mdash;one day after the
sixty-first anniversary of his baptism in Antwerp.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Chapelmaster van Beethoven’s Trials</span></div>

<p>At home the good man had his cross to bear. His wife,
Josepha, who with one exception had buried all her children, and
possibly on that very account, became addicted to the indulgence
of an appetite for strong drink, was at the date of her
husband’s death living as a boarder in a cloister at Cologne.
How long she had been there does not appear, but doubtless for
a considerable period. The son, too, was married, but though
near was not in his father’s house. The separation was brought
about by his marriage, with which the father was not agreed.
The house in which the chapelmaster died, and which he occupied
certainly as early as 1765, was that next north of the so-called
Gudenauer Hof, later the post-office in the neighboring Bonngasse,
and bore the number 386. The chapelmaster appears, upon
pretty good evidence, to have removed hither from the Fischer
house in the Rheingasse, where he is said to have lived many years
and even to have carried on a trade in wine, which change of
dwelling may have taken place in 1767.</p>

<p>When one recalls the imposing style of dress at the era the
short, muscular man, with dark complexion and very bright eyes,
as Wegeler describes him<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> and as a painting by Courtpainter
Radoux, still in possession of his descendants in Vienna, depicts
him, presents quite an imposing picture to the imagination.</p>

<p>Of the early life of Johann van Beethoven there are no particulars
preserved except such as are directly or indirectly conveyed
in the official documents. Such of these papers as came
from his own hand, if judged by the standard of our time, show
a want of ordinary education; but it must not be forgotten that
the orthography of the German language was not then fixed;
nor that many a contemporary of his, who boasted a university<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
education, or who belonged to the highest ranks of society, wrote
in a style no better than his. This is certain: that after he had
received an elementary education he was sent to the <i>Gymnasium</i>,
for as a member of the lowest class (<i>infima</i>) of that institution he
took part in September, 1750, as singer in the annual school play
which it was the custom of the <i>Musæ Bonnenses</i> to give. It
would seem, therefore, that his good voice and musical gifts were
appreciated at an early period. Herein, probably, is also to be
found the reason why his stay at the gymnasium was not of long
duration. The father had set him apart for service in the court
music, and himself, as appears from the statements already printed,
undertook his instruction; he taught him singing and clavier
playing. Whether or not he also taught him violin playing, in
which he was “capable,” remains uncertain. In 1752, at the
age of 12, as can be seen from his petition of March, 1756, and his
father’s of 1764, he entered the chapel as soprano. According
to Gottwald’s report of 1756 he had served “about 2 years”; the
contradiction is probably explained by an interruption caused by
the mutation of his voice. At the age of 16, he received his
<i>decretum</i> as “accessist” on the score of his skill in singing and
his experience already acquired, including his capability on the
violin, which was the basis of the decree of April 24, 1764, granting
him a salary of 100 rth. per annum.</p>

<p>So, at the age of 22, the young man received the promise
of a salary, and at 24 obtained one of 100 thalers. In 1769, he
received an increase of 25 fl., and 50 fl. more by the decree of
April 3, 1772. He had, moreover, an opportunity to gain something
by teaching. Not only did he give lessons in singing and
clavier playing to the children of prominent families of the city,
but he also frequently was called on to prepare young musicians
for service in the chapel. Thus Demmer, says the memorandum
heretofore given, “paid 6 rth. to young Mr. Beethoven for 3
months”; and a year later the following resolve of the privy
council was passed:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="date">

<p class="sig">Attest. P.</p></div>

<p>which probably refers to a debt contracted by one of the women
of the court chapel. A few years later, as we have seen, he seems<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
to have been intrusted with the training of Johanna Helena
Averdonck, whom he brought forward as his pupil in March, 1778,
and the singer Gazzenello was his pupil before she went elsewhere.
It was largely his own fault that the musically gifted man was
unfortunate in both domestic and official relations. His intemperance
in drink, probably inherited from his mother but attributed
by old Fischer to the wine trade in which his father embarked,
made itself apparent at an early date, and by yielding to it more
and more as he grew older he undoubtedly impaired his voice and
did much to bring about his later condition of poverty. How it
finally led to a catastrophe we shall see later. According to the
testimony of the widow Karth, he was a tall, handsome man, and
wore powdered hair in his later years. Fischer does not wholly
agree with her: “of medium height, longish face, broad forehead,
round nose, broad shoulders, serious eyes, face somewhat scarred,
thin pigtail.” Three and a half years after obtaining his salary
of 100 th. he ventured to marry. Heinrich Kewerich, the father
of his wife, was head cook in that palace at Ehrenbreitstein in
which Clemens danced himself out of this world, but he died before
that event took place.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> His wife, as the church records testify,
was Anna Clara Daubach. Her daughter Maria Magdalena,
born December 19, 1746, married a certain Johann Laym, valet
of the Elector of Trèves, on January 30, 1763. On November
28, 1765, the husband died, and Maria Magdalena was a widow
before she had completed her 19th year. In a little less than two
years the marriage register of St. Remigius, at Bonn, was enriched
by this entry:</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">The Parents of the Composer</span></div>

Westorffs filiam legitimam. Coram testibus Josepho clemente Belseroski

<p>That is, Johann van Beethoven has married the young
widow Laym.</p>

<p>How it came that the marriage took place in Bonn instead of
the home of the bride we are told by Fischer. Chapelmaster van
Beethoven was not at all agreed that his son should marry a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
woman of a lower station in life than his own. He did not continue
his opposition against the fixed determination of his son; but it
is to be surmised that he would not have attended a ceremony in
Ehrenbreitstein, and hence the matter was disposed of quickly
in Bonn. After the wedding the young pair paid a visit of a few
days’ duration to Ehrenbreitstein.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Character of Mme. van Beethoven</span></div>

<p>Fischer describes Madame van Beethoven as a “handsome,
slender person” and tells of her “rather tall, longish face, a nose
somewhat bent (<i>gehöffelt</i>, in the dialect of Bonn), spare, earnest
eyes.” Cäcilia Fischer could not recall that she had ever seen
Madame van Beethoven laugh; “she was always serious.” Her
life’s vicissitudes may have contributed to this disposition:&mdash;the
early loss of her father, and of her first husband, and the
death of her mother scarcely more than a year after her second
marriage. It is difficult to form a conception of her character
because of the paucity of information about her. Wegeler lays
stress upon her piety and gentleness; her amiability and kindliness
towards her family appear from all the reports; nevertheless,
Fischer betrays the fact that she could be vehement in controversies
with the other occupants of the house. “Madame van
Beethoven,” Fischer continues, “was a clever woman; she could
give converse and reply aptly, politely and modestly to high and
low, and for this reason she was much liked and respected. She
occupied herself with sewing and knitting. They led a righteous
and peaceful married life, and paid their house-rent and baker’s
bills promptly, quarterly, and on the day. She<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> was a good, a
domestic woman, she knew how to give and also how to take in a
manner that is becoming to all people of honest thoughts.” From
this it is fair to assume that she strove to conduct her household
judiciously and economically; whether or not this was always
possible in view of the limited income, old Fischer does not seem
to have been informed. She made the best she could of the
weaknesses of her husband without having been able to influence
him; her care for the children in externals was not wholly sufficient.
Young Ludwig clung to her with a tender love, more than to the
father, who was “only severe”; but there is nothing anywhere to
indicate that she exerted an influence upon the emotional life
and development of her son, and in respect of this no wrong will
be done her if the lower order of her culture be taken into consideration.
Nor must it be forgotten that in all probability she was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
naturally delicate and that her health was still further weakened
by her domestic troubles and frequent accouchements.
The “quiet, suffering woman,” as Madame Karth calls her, died
in 1787 of consumption at the age of 40 years. Long years after
in Vienna Beethoven was wont, when among his intimate friends,
to speak of his “excellent” (<i>vortreffliche</i>) mother.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>At the time when Johann van Beethoven married, there was
quite a colony of musicians, and other persons in the service of
the court, in the Bonngasse, as that street is in part named which
extends from the lower extremity of the market-place to the
Cologne gate. Chapelmaster van Beethoven had left the house
in the Rheingasse and lived at No. 386. In the adjoining house,
north, No. 387, lived the musical family Ries. Farther down, the
east house on that side of the way before the street assumes the
name Kölnerstrasse was the dwelling of the hornist, afterward
publisher, Simrock. Nearly opposite the chapelmaster’s the second
story of the house No. 515 was occupied (but not till after 1771)
by the Salomons; the parterre and first floor by the owner of the
house, a lace-maker or dealer in laces, named Clasen. Of the
two adjoining houses the one No. 576 was the dwelling of Johann
Baum, a master locksmith, doubtless the Jean Courtin, “serrurier,”
of the Court Calendar for 1773. In No. 617 was the family
Hertel, twelve or fifteen years later living under the Beethovens
in the Wenzelgasse, and not far off a family, Poll, perhaps relations
of Madame Beethoven the elder. Conrad Poll’s name is
found in the Court Calendars of the 1770’s as one of the eight
Electoral “Heiducken” (footmen). In 1767 in the rear of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
Clasen house, north<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> there was a lodging to let; and there the
newly married Beethovens began their humble housekeeping.
Their first child was a son, Ludwig Maria, baptized April 2, 1769,
whose sponsors, as may be read in the register of St. Remigius
parish, were the grandfather Beethoven and Anna Maria Lohe,
wife of Jean Courtin, the next-door neighbor. This child lived
but six days. In two years the loss of the parents was made up
by the birth of him who is the subject of this biography.</p>

<p>The sponsors, therefore, were Beethoven’s grandfather the
chapelmaster, and the wife of the next-door neighbor, Johann
Baum, secretary at the electoral cellar. The custom obtaining
at the time in the Catholic Rhine country not to postpone the
baptism beyond 24 hours after the birth of a child, it is in the
highest degree probable that Beethoven was born on December
16, 1770.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>On the back of this paper Beethoven wrote:</p>

<p>The composer, then, even in his fortieth year still believed
the correct date to be 1772, which is the one given in all the old
biographical notices, and which corresponds to the dates affixed
to many of his first works, and indeed to nearly all allusions to
his age in his early years. Only by keeping this fact in mind,
can the long list of chronological contradictions, which continually
meet the student of his history during the first half of his life,
be explained or comprehended. Whoever examines the original
record of baptism in the registry at Bonn, sees instantly that
the certificate, in spite of Beethoven, is correct; but all possible
doubt is removed by the words of Wegeler:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Little Louis clung to this grandfather ... with the greatest affection,
and, young as he was when he lost him, his early impressions always
remained lively. He liked to speak of his grandfather with the friends
of his youth, and his pious and gentle mother, whom he loved much more
than he did his father, who was only severe, was obliged to tell him much
of his grandfather.</p></div>

<p>Had 1772 been the correct date the child could never have
retained personal recollections of a man who died on December
24, 1773. A survey of the whole ground renders the conclusion
irresistible that at the time when the boy began to attract notice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
by his skill upon the pianoforte and by the promise of his first
attempts in composition, his age was purposely falsified, a motive
for which may perhaps be found in the excitement caused in the
musical world by the then recent career of the Mozart children, and
in the reflection that attainments which in a child of eight or
ten years excite wonder and astonishment are considered hardly
worthy of special remark in one a few years older. There is, unfortunately,
nothing known of Johann van Beethoven’s character
which renders such a trick improbable. Noteworthy is it that,
at first, the falsification rarely extends beyond one year; and,
also, that in an official report in 1784 the correct age is given.
Here an untruth could not be risked, nor be of advantage if it had
been.</p>

<p>Dr. C. M. Kneisel, who championed the cause of the house
in the Bonngasse in a controversy conducted in the “Kölnische
Zeitung” in 1845, touching the birthplace of Beethoven, remarks
that the mother “was, as is known, a native of the Ehrenbreitstein
valley and separated from her relatives; he (Johann van
Beethoven) was without relatives and in somewhat straitened
circumstances financially. What, then, was more natural than
that he should invite his neighbor, Frau Baum, a respected and
well-to-do woman, <i>in whose house the baptismal feast was held</i>, to
be sponsor for his little son?” This last fact indicates clearly
the narrowness of the quarters in which the young couple dwelt.
Does it not also hint that the grandfather was now a solitary man
with no home in which to spread the little feast? Let Johann
van Beethoven himself describe the pecuniary condition in which
he found himself upon the death of his father:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="add">
Most Reverend Archbishop,
Most Gracious Elector and Lord, Lord.
</p>

<p>Will Your Electoral Grace graciously be pleased to hear that my
father has passed away from this world, to whom it was granted to serve
his Electoral Grace Clemens August and Your Electoral Grace and
gloriously reigning Lord Lord 42 years, as chapelmaster with great
honor, whose position I have been found capable of filling, but nevertheless
I would not venture to offer my capacity to Your Electoral Grace, but
since the death of my father has left me in needy circumstances my
salary not sufficing and I compelled to draw on the savings of my father,
my mother still living and in a cloister at a cost of 60 rth. for board
and lodging each year and it is not advisable for me to take her to my
home. Your Electoral Grace is therefore humbly implored to make an
allowance from the 400 rth. vacated for an increase of my salary so
that I may not need to draw upon the little savings and my mother
may receive the pension graciously for the few years which she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
may yet live, to deserve which high grace it shall always be my
striving.</p>

<p class="sig">
Your Electoral Grace’s<br />
Most humble and obedient<br />
Servant and musicus jean van Beethoven.</p></div>

<p>There is something bordering on the comic in the coolness
of the hint here given that the petitioner would not object to an
appointment as his father’s successor, especially when it is remembered
that Lucchesi and Mattioli were already in Bonn and the
former had sufficiently proved his capacity by producing successful
operas, both text and music, for the Elector’s delectation.
The hint was not taken; what provision was granted him, however,
may be seen from a petition of January 8, 1774, praying
for an addition to his salary from that made vacant by the death
of his father, and a pension to his mother who is kept at board
in a cloister. A memorandum appears on the margin to the effect
that the Elector graciously consents that the widow, so long as
she remains in the cloister, shall receive 60 rth. quarterly.
Another petition of a year later has been lost, but its contents are
indicated in the response, dated June 5, 1775, that Johann van
Beethoven on the death of his mother shall have the enjoyment
of the 60 rth. which had been granted her. The death of the
mother followed a few months later and was thus announced in
the “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Intelligenzblatt</span>” of Bonn on October 3, 1775: “Died, on
September 30, Maria Josepha Pals (<i>sic</i>), widow van Beethoven,
aged 61 years.” In a list of salaries for 1776 (among the papers
at Düsseldorf) for the “Musik Parthie” the salary of Johann van
Beethoven is given at 36 rth. 45 alb. payable quarterly. The
fact of the great poverty in which he and his family lived is manifest
from the official documents (which confirm the many traditions
to that effect) and from the more important recollections of
aged people of Bonn brought to light in a controversy concerning
the birthplace of the composer. For instance, Dr. Hennes,
in his unsuccessful effort to establish the claims of the Fischer
house in the Rheingasse, says: “The legacy left him (Johann van
Beethoven) by his father did not last long. That fine linen,
which, as I was told, could be drawn through a ring, found its way,
piece by piece, out of the house; even the beautiful large portrait
showing the father wearing a tasseled cap and holding a roll of
music, went to the second-hand shop.” This is an error, though
the painting may have gone for a time to the pawnbroker.</p>

<p>From the Bonngasse the Beethovens removed, when, is uncertain,
to a house No. 7 or No. 8 on the left as one enters the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
Dreieckplatz in passing from the Sternstrasse to the Münsterplatz.
They were living there in 1774, for the baptism of another son
on the 8th of April of that year is recorded in the register of the
parish of St. Gangolph, to which those houses belonged. This
child’s name was Caspar Anton Carl, the first two names from his
sponsor the Minister Belderbusch, the third from Caroline von
Satzenhofen, Abbess of Vilich. Was this condescension on the
part of the minister and the abbess intended to soothe the father
under the failure of his hopes of advancement? From the Dreieckplatz
the Beethovens migrated to the Fischer house, No. 934 in
the Rheingasse, so long held to be the composer’s birthplace and
long thereafter distinguished by a false inscription to that effect.
Whether the removal took place in Ludwig’s fifth or sixth year
is not known; but at all events it was previous to the 2nd of
October, 1776, for upon that day another son of Johann van Beethoven
was baptized in the parish of St. Remigius by the name of
Nicholas Johann. Dr. Hennes in his letter to the “Kölnische
Zeitung” lays much stress upon the testimony of Cäcilia Fischer.
He says: “the maiden lady of 76 years, Cäcilia Fischer, still
remembers distinctly to have seen little Louis in his cradle and
can tell many anecdotes about him, etc.” The mistake is easily
explained without supposing any intentional deception:&mdash;62
years afterwards she mistook the birth of Nicholas Johann for
that of Ludwig. According to Fischer’s report the family removed
from this house in 1776 for a short time to one in the
Neugasse, but returned again to the house in the Rheingasse
after the palace fire in 1777. One thought which suggests itself
in relation to these removals of Johann van Beethoven may,
perhaps, be more than mere fancy: that in expectation of advancement
in position upon the death of his father he had exchanged
the narrow quarters of the lodging in the rear of the Clasen house
for the much better dwelling in the Dreieckplatz; but upon the
failure of his hopes had been fain to seek a cheaper place in the
lower part of the town down near the river.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">The Boy Beethoven’s Early Study</span></div>

<p>There is nothing decisive as to the time when the musical
education of Ludwig van Beethoven began, nor any positive
evidence that he, like Handel, Haydn or Mozart, showed remarkable
genius for the art at a very early age. Schlosser has something
on this point, but he gives no authorities, while the particulars
which he relates could not possibly have come under his
own observation. Müller<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> had heard from Franz Ries and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
Nicholas Simrock that Johann van Beethoven gave his son instruction
upon the pianoforte and violin “in his earliest childhood....
To scarcely anything else did he hold him.” In the
dedication of the pianoforte sonatas (1783) to the Elector, the
boy is made to say: “Music became my first youthful pursuit
in my fourth year,” which might be supposed decisive on the point
if his age were not falsely given on the title-page. This much is
certain: that after the removal to the Fischer house the child
had his daily task of musical study and practice given him and in
spite of his tears was forced to execute it. “Cäcilia Fischer,”
writes Hennes (1838), “still sees him, a tiny boy, standing on a
little footstool in front of the clavier to which the implacable severity
of his father had so early condemned him. The patriarch of
Bonn, Head Burgomaster Windeck, will pardon me if I appeal to
him to say that he, too, saw the little Louis van Beethoven in this
house standing in front of the clavier and weeping.” To this
writes Dr. Wegeler:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I saw the same thing. How? The Fischer house was, perhaps
still is, connected by a passage-way in the rear with a house in the
Giergasse, which was then occupied by the owner, a high official of the
Rhenish revenue service, Mr. Bachen, grandfather of Court Councillor
Bachen of this city. The youngest son of the latter, Benedict, was my
schoolmate, and on my visits to him the doings and sufferings of Louis
were visible from the house.</p></div>

<p>It must be supposed that the father had seen indications of
his son’s genius, for it is difficult to imagine such an one remaining
unperceived; but the necessities of the family with the failure
of the petition for a better salary&mdash;sent in just at the time when
the Elector was so largely increasing his expenditures for music
by the engagement of Lucchesi and Mattioli and in other ways&mdash;are
sufficient reasons for the inflexible severity with which the
boy was kept at his studies. The desire to say something new
and striking on the part of many who have written about Beethoven
has led to such an admixture of fact and fancy that it is
now very difficult to separate them. One (Schlosser) tells his
readers that “the greatest joy of the lad was when his father took
him upon his knees and permitted him to accompany a song on
the clavier with his tiny fingers,” while others tell the tale of
his childhood in a manner to convey the idea that the father was
a pitiless tyrant, the boy a victim and a slave&mdash;an error which
a calm consideration of what is really known of the facts in the
case at once dispels. There is but one road to excellence, even
for the genius of a Handel or a Mozart&mdash;unremitted application.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
To this young Ludwig was compelled, sometimes, no doubt,
through the fear or the actual infliction of punishment for neglect;
sometimes, too, the father, whose habits were such as to favor
a bad interpretation of his conduct, was no doubt harsh and unjust.
And such seems to be the truth. At any rate, the boy at
an early date acquired so considerable a facility upon the clavier
that his father could have him play at court and when he was
seven years old produce him with one of his pupils at a concert in
Bonn. Here is the announcement of the concert as it was reproduced
in the “Kölnische Zeitung” of December 18, 1870, from
the original:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="center">AVERTISSEMENT</p>

<p>To-day, March 26, 1778, in the musical concert-room in the Sternengasse
the Electoral Court Tenorist, Beethoven, will have the honor to
produce two of his scholars, namely, Mlle. Averdonck, Court Contraltist,
and his little son of six years. The former will have the honor
to contribute various beautiful arias, the latter various clavier concertos
and trios. He flatters himself that he will give complete enjoyment to
all ladies and gentlemen, the more since both have had the honor of
playing to the greatest delight of the entire Court.</p>

<p class="center">Beginning at five o’clock in the evening.</p>

<p>Ladies and gentlemen who have not subscribed will be charged a
florin. Tickets may be had at the aforesaid Akademiesaal, also of
Mr. Claren auf der Bach in Mühlenstein.</p></div>

<p>Unfortunately we learn nothing concerning the pieces played
by the boy nor of the success of his performance. That the violin
as well as the pianoforte was practised by him is implicitly confirmed
by the terms in which Schindler records his denial of the
truth of the well-known spider story: “The great Ludwig refused
to remember any such incident, much as the tale amused him.
On the contrary, he said it was more to be expected that everything
would have fled from his scraping, even flies and spiders.”</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Paucity of Intellectual Training</span></div>

<p>The father’s main object being the earliest and greatest
development of his son’s musical genius so as to make it a “marketable
commodity,” he gave him no other school education than
such as was afforded in one of the public schools. Fischer says
he first attended a school in the Neugasse taught by a man named
Huppert<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> and thence went to the Münsterschule. Among the
lower grade schools in Bonn was the so-called Tirocinium, a Latin
school, which prepared pupils for the gymnasium but was not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
directly connected with it, but had its own corps of teachers, like
the whole educational system of the period, under the supervision
of the Academic Council established by Max Friedrich in 1777.
The pupils learned, outside of the elementary studies (arithmetic
and writing are said to have been excluded), to read and write
Latin up to an understanding of Cornelius Nepos. Johann Krengel,
a much respected pedagogue, was teacher at the time and was
appointed municipal schoolmaster in 1783 by the Academic
Council. In 1786 he transferred the school to the Bonngasse.
To this school young Beethoven was sent; when, is uncertain.
His contemporary and schoolfellow Wurzer, Electoral Councillor
and afterwards president of the Landgericht, relates the following
in his memoirs:<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>One of my schoolmates under Krengel was Luis van Beethoven,
whose father held an appointment as court singer under the Elector.
Apparently his mother was already dead at the time,<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> for Luis v. B. was
distinguished by uncleanliness, negligence, etc. Not a sign was to be
discovered in him of that spark of genius which glowed so brilliantly
in him afterwards. I imagine that he was kept down to his musical
studies from an early age by his father.</p></div>

<p>Wurzer entered the gymnasium in 1781; Beethoven did not.
This, therefore, must have been the time at which all other studies
were abandoned in favor of music. In what manner his education
was otherwise pieced out is not to be learned. The lack of
proper intellectual discipline is painfully obvious in Beethoven’s
letters throughout his life. In his early manhood he wrote a
fair hand, so very different from the shocking scrawl of his later
years as to make one almost doubt the genuineness of autographs
of that period; but in orthography, the use of capital letters,
punctuation and arithmetic he was sadly deficient all his life long.
He was still able to use the French tongue at a later period, and
of Latin he had learned enough to understand the texts which
he composed; but even as a schoolboy his studies appear to have
been made second to his musical practice with which his hours
out of school were apparently for the most part occupied. He
was described by Dr. Müller as “a shy and taciturn boy, the necessary
consequence of the life apart which he led, observing more
and pondering more than he spoke, and disposed to abandon
himself entirely to the feelings awakened by music and (later)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
by poetry and to the pictures created by fancy.” Of those who
were his schoolfellows and who in after years recorded their reminiscences
of him, not one speaks of him as a playfellow, none has
anecdotes to relate of games with him, rambles on the hills or adventures
upon the Rhine and its shores in which he bore a part.
Music and ever music; hence the power of clothing his thoughts
in words was not developed by early culture, and the occasional
bursts of eloquence in his letters and recorded conversations
are held not to be genuine, because so seldom found. As if the
strong mind, struggling for adequate expression, should not at
times break through all barriers and overcome all obstacles!<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>
Urged forward thus by the father’s severity, by his tender love
for his mother and by the awakening of his own tastes, the development
of his skill and talents was rapid; so much so that in his
ninth year a teacher more competent than his father was needed.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Beethoven and van den Eeden</span></div>

<p>The first to whom his father turned was the old court organist
van den Eeden, who had been in the electoral service about
fifty years and had come to Bonn before the arrival there of Ludwig
van Beethoven, the grandfather. One can easily imagine
his willingness to serve an old and deceased friend by fitting his
grandson to become his successor; and this might account for
Schlosser’s story that at first he taught him gratis, and that he
continued his instructions at the command and expense of the
Elector. The story may or may not be true, but nothing has
been discovered in the archives at Düsseldorf confirming the
statement; in fact concerning the time, the subjects and the results
of van den Eeden’s instruction we are thrown largely upon
conjecture. “In his eighth year,” says Mäurer in his notices,
“Court Organist van den Eeden took him as a pupil; nothing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
has been learned of his progress.” This, if Mäurer was correct
in stating his age, would have been about 1778. It is after this
that Mäurer refers to his study under Pfeiffer. Independently
of all this Fischer says: “His father not being able to teach him
more in music, and suspecting that he had talent for composition,
took him at first to an aged master named Santerrini who instructed
him for a while; but the father thought little of this teacher, did
not consider him the right man and desired a change.” This
desire resulted in securing Pfeiffer through the mediation of
Grossmann. There was no musician Santerrini in the court chapel,
but an actor, named Santorini, was a member of Grossmann’s
troupe; he cannot be considered in this connection. There is
evidently a confusion of names, and the whole context, especially
the reference to the “aged master,” shows that no other than van
den Eeden was meant by the teacher who gave instruction for a
short time before Pfeiffer.</p>

<p>Schlosser does not say that this instruction was on the organ
and it is unlikely that the boy, who was destined for a more systematic
instruction in pianoforte playing, was put at the organ
at so early an age. It was a deduction, probably, from the fact
that van den Eeden was an organist and that later Beethoven displayed
a great deal of dexterity upon that instrument. It is
noteworthy that Wegeler (p. 11) says nothing definite as to
whether or not Beethoven took lessons from van den Eeden; he
merely thought it likely, because he knew no one else in Bonn
from whom Beethoven could have learned the technical handling
of the organ. But there were several such in Bonn irrespective of
Neefe. Schindler makes certainty out of Wegeler’s conjecture
and relates that Beethoven often spoke of the old organist when
discoursing upon the proper position and movement of the body
and hands in organ and pianoforte playing, he having been taught
to hold both calm and steady, to play in the connected style of
Handel and Bach. This may have been correct so far as pianoforte
playing is concerned; but Schindler had little knowledge
of Beethoven’s Bonn period, and the possibility of a confusion
of names is not excluded even on the part of Beethoven himself,
who received hints from several organists. Mäurer, after speaking
of Pfeiffer, continues as follows: “Van den Eeden remained
his only teacher in thorough-bass. As a man of seventy he sent
the boy Louis, between eleven and twelve years old, to accompany
the mass and other church music on the organ. His playing
was so astonishing that one was forced to believe he had intentionally
concealed his gifts. While preluding for the <i>Credo</i> he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
took a theme from the movement and developed it to the amazement
of the orchestra so that he was permitted to improvise
longer than is customary. That was the opening of his brilliant
career.” Mäurer seems to know nothing of Neefe when he says
that van den Eeden was Beethoven’s only teacher in thorough-bass.
What he says, too, about the lad’s performance at the
organ as substitute obviously rests upon a confounding of van
den Eeden with another of Beethoven’s organ teachers&mdash;most
likely Neefe.</p>

<p>It is our conjecture that van den Eeden taught the boy chiefly
and perhaps exclusively pianoforte playing, he being a master
in that art; but his influence was small. It must be remembered
that van den Eeden was a very old man, as whose successor
Neefe had been chosen in 1781, and who died in June, 1782.
Nowhere does he, like the other teachers of Beethoven, disclose
individual traits; he is a totally colorless picture in the history
of Beethoven’s youth. Nor does it appear that there was any
intimacy between him and the Beethoven family, since otherwise
he would not have been missing in the notices of Fischer,
who does not even know his name. The judgment of the father
that his instruction was inefficient was probably correct.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Other Teachers of the Boy Beethoven</span></div>

<p>A fitter master, it was thought, was obtained in Tobias
Friedrich Pfeiffer, who came to Bonn in the summer of 1779, as
tenor singer in Grossmann and Helmuth’s theatrical company.
Mäurer, the violoncellist, in some reminiscences of that period communicated
to this work by Professor Jahn, says that Pfeiffer was
a skillful pianist and gave the boy lessons, but not at any regular
hours. Often when he came with Beethoven, the father, from
the wine-house late at night, the boy was roused from sleep and
kept at the pianoforte until morning;&mdash;a course not particularly
favorable to his progress at school, but one which may be readily
credited in the light of what is known of Pfeiffer and Johann Beethoven,
and one, moreover, which would cause the lessons to make
an enduring impression upon the memory. There is some reason
to think that the former was an inmate of the latter’s family,
which adds probability to the story. Although Pfeiffer was in
Bonn but one year, Wegeler affirms that “Beethoven owed most
of all to this teacher, and was so appreciative of the fact that
he sent him financial help from Vienna through Simrock.” To
what extent Wegeler’s opinion as to Beethoven’s obligations is
correct, it would be difficult to decide; but the utter improbability
that a single year’s lessons from this man would profit a
boy eight and a half to nine and a half years old, more than those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
from any other of his teachers, much longer and systematically
continued, is manifest. About this time the young court musician
Franz Georg Rovantini lived in the same house with Beethoven.
He was the son of a violinist Johann Conrad Rovantini who had
been called to Bonn from Ehrenbreitstein and who died in 1766.
He was related to the Beethoven family. The young musician
was much respected and sought after as teacher. According to
the Fischer document the boy Beethoven was among his pupils,
taking lessons on the violin and viola. But these lessons, too,
came to an early end; Rovantini died on September 9, 1781,
aged 24.</p>

<p>A strong predilection for the organ was awakened early in
the lad and he eagerly sought opportunities to study the instrument,
apparently even before he became Neefe’s pupil. In the
cloister of the Franciscan monks at Bonn there lived a friar
named Willibald Koch, highly respected for his playing and his
expert knowledge of organ construction. We have no reason to
doubt that young Ludwig sought him out, received instruction
from him and made so much progress that Friar Willibald accepted
him as assistant. In the same way he made friends with the
organist in the cloister of the Minorites and “made an agreement”
to play the organ there at 6 o’clock morning mass. It would
seem that he felt the need of familiarity with a larger organ than
that of the Franciscans. On the inside of the cover of a memorandum
book which he carried to Vienna with him is found the
note: “Measurements (<i>Fussmass</i>) of the Minorite pedals in
Bonn.” Plainly he had kept an interest in the organ. Still
another tradition is preserved in a letter to the author from Miss
Auguste Grimm, dated September, 1872, to the effect that Heinrich
Theisen, born in 1759, organist at Rheinbreitbach near Honneck
on the Rhine, studied the organ in company with Beethoven
under Zenser, organist of the Münsterkirche at Bonn, and that
the lad of ten years surpassed his fellow student of twenty. The
tradition says that already at that time Ludwig composed pieces
which were too difficult for his little hands. “Why, you can’t
play that, Ludwig,” his teacher is said to have remarked, and the
boy to have replied: “I will when I am bigger.”</p>

<p>When Beethoven’s studies with van den Eeden began and
ended, whether they were confined to the organ or pianoforte,
or partook of both&mdash;these are undecided points. It does not
appear that any instruction in composition was given him until
he became the pupil of Neefe. In the <i>facsimile</i> which follows
the part devoted to thorough-bass in the so-called “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Studien</span>,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
the composer says: “Dear Friends: I took the pains to learn
this only that I might write the figures readily and later instruct
others; for myself I never had to learn how to avoid errors, for
from my childhood I had so keen a sensibility that I wrote correctly
without knowing it had to be so, or could be otherwise.”
This lends plausibility, at least, to another anecdote related by
Mäurer concerning an alleged precocious composition by Beethoven:</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">The Story of a First Composition</span></div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>About this time the English Ambassador to the Elector’s court,
named Kressner, who had extended help to the Beethoven family, living
scantily on a salary of 400 fl. [?], died. Louis composed a funeral cantata
to his memory&mdash;his first composition. He handed his score to Lucchesi
and asked him to correct the errors. Lucchesi gave it back with the
remark that he could not understand it, and therefore could not comply
with his request, but would have it performed. At the first rehearsal
there was great astonishment at the originality of the composition, but
approval was divided; after a few rehearsals the approbation grew and
the piece was performed with general applause.</p></div>

<p>George Cressener came to Bonn in the autumn of 1755, and
died there January 17, 1781, in the eighty-first year of his age.
The “about this time” in Mäurer’s story agrees, therefore, well
enough with that date; it is, however, a suspicious circumstance
that Mäurer had left the service and returned to Cologne in the
Spring of 1780 and, therefore, was not eye-witness to the fact;
and another that the circumstance was not remembered by other
members of the court chapel, not even by Franz Ries, nor by
Neefe, who, though not then a member, was already in Bonn.
“In 1780,” continues Mäurer, “Beethoven got acquainted with
Zambona, who called his attention to his neglected education,
gave him lessons daily in Latin, Louis continuing a year (in six
weeks he read Cicero’s letters!)&mdash;also logic, French and Italian&mdash;until
Zambona left Bonn in order to become bookkeeper for
Bartholdy in Mühlheim.” In the “Geheime Staats-Conferenz
Protocollen,” May 20, 1787, one reads: “Stephan Zambona prays
to be appointed, <i>Kammerportier</i>, etc.,” to which is appended the
remark: “the request not granted.” Zambona is a name, too,
which, half a dozen years later, often appears in the Bonn “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Intelligenzblatt</span>,”
as that of a shopkeeper in the Market Place of that
town. If the story of the cantata be doubtful, that of these
private studies on the part of a boy in Beethoven’s position,
only in his tenth year and a schoolboy then if ever, like
Hamlet’s possible dreams in the sleep of death, must “give us
pause.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>Mother and son undertook a voyage to Holland in the beginning
of the winter of 1781. The widow Karth, one of the Hertel
family, born in 1780 and still living in Bonn in 1861, passed her
childhood in the house No. 462 Wenzelgasse in the upper story
of which the Beethovens then lived. One of her reminiscences
is in place here. She distinctly remembered sitting, when a
child, upon her own mother’s knee, and hearing Madame van
Beethoven&mdash;“a quiet, suffering woman”&mdash;relate that when she
went with her little boy Ludwig to Holland it was so cold on the
boat that she had to hold his feet in her lap to prevent them from
being frostbitten; and also that, while absent, Ludwig played a
great deal in great houses, astonished people by his skill and
received valuable presents. The circumstance of the cold feet
warmed in the mother’s lap, is precisely one to fasten itself in
the memory of a child and form a point around which other facts
might cluster.<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<p>Another incident related in connection with this journey to
Holland&mdash;not as a fact, but as one which she had heard spoken
of in her childhood&mdash;and one very difficult to comprehend, is,
that some person, whether an envious boy or a heartless adult
she could not tell, drew a knife across the fingers of Ludwig to
disable him from playing!</p>

<h2>Chapter IV</h2>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Beethoven a Pupil of Neefe&mdash;His Talent and Skill Put to
Use&mdash;First Efforts at Composition&mdash;Johann van Beethoven’s
Family&mdash;Domestic Tribulations.</p></div>


<p>Christian Gottlob Neefe succeeded the persons mentioned
as Beethoven’s master in music. When this tutorship
began and ended, and whether or not it be true that the Elector
engaged and paid him for his services in this capacity, as affirmed
by divers writers&mdash;here again positive evidence is wanting. Neefe
came to Bonn in October, 1779; received the decree of succession
to the position of Court Organist on February 15, 1781, and was
thus permanently engaged in the Elector’s service. The unsatisfactory
nature of the earlier instruction, as well as the high reputation
of Neefe, placed in the strongest light before the Bonn
public by those proceedings which had compelled him to remain
there, would render it highly desirable to Johann van Beethoven
to transfer his son to the latter’s care. It would create no surprise
should proof hereafter come to light that this change was made
even before the issue of the decree of February 15, 1781;&mdash;that
even then the pupil was profiting by the lessons of the zealous
Bachist. Whether this was so or not, it was more than ever
necessary that the boy’s talents should be put to profitable use,
for the father found his family still increasing. The baptism
of a daughter named Anna Maria Franciska after her sponsors
Anna Maria Klemmers, <i>dicta</i> Kochs, and Franz Rovantini, court
musician, is recorded in the St. Remigius register February 23,
1779, and her death on the 27th of the same month. The baptism
of August Franciscus Georgius van Beethoven&mdash;Franz Rovantini,
<i>Musicus Aulicus</i> and Helene Averdonk, <i>patrini</i>, follows nearly
two years later&mdash;January 17, 1781. There is no minister of
State now to lend his name to a child of Johann van Beethoven,
nor any lady abbess. Rovantini, one of the youngest members
of the orchestra (relative and friend of the family), and a Frau
Kochs, the young contralto, whose musical education the father<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
had superintended, take their places&mdash;another indication that the
head of the family is gradually sinking in social position.</p>

<p>It is Schlosser who states that “the Elector urged Neefe to
make it his particular care to look after the training of the young
Beethoven.” How much weight is to be attached to this assertion
of a man who hastily threw a few pages together soon after
the death of the composer, and who begins by adopting the old
error of 1772 as the date of his birth, and naming his father
“Anton,” may safely be left to the reader. That the story may
possibly have some foundation in truth is not denied; but the
probabilities are all against it. Just in these years Max Friedrich
is busy with his tric-trac, his balls, his new operettas and comedies,
and with his notion of making the theatre a school of morals.
The truth seems to be (and it is the only hypothesis that suggests
itself, corresponding to the established facts), that Johann van
Beethoven had now determined to make an organist of his son
as the surest method of making his talents productive. The
appointment of Neefe necessarily destroyed Ludwig’s hope of
being van den Eeden’s successor; but Neefe’s other numerous
employments would make an assistant indispensable, and to
this place the boy might well aspire. It will be seen in the course
of the narrative that Beethoven never had a warmer, kinder and
more valuable friend than Neefe proved throughout the remainder
of his Bonn life; that, in fact, his first appointment was obtained
for him through Neefe, although this is the first hint yet published
that the credit does not belong to a very different personage.
What, then, so natural, so self-evident as that Neefe, foreseeing
the approaching necessity of some one to take charge of the little
organ in the chapel at times when his duties to the Grossmann
company would prevent him from officiating in person, should
gladly undertake the training of the remarkable talents of van
den Eeden’s pupil with no wish for any other remuneration than
the occasional services which the youth could render him?</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Neefe’s Influence on Beethoven</span></div>

<p>Dr. Wegeler remarks: “Neefe had little influence upon the
instruction of our Ludwig, who frequently complained of the too
severe criticisms made on his first efforts in composition.” The
first of these assertions is evidently an utter mistake. In 1793
Beethoven himself, at all events, thought differently: “I thank
you for the counsel which you gave me so often in my progress
in my divine art. If I ever become a great man yours shall be
a share of the credit. This will give you the greater joy since
you may rest assured,” etc. Thus he wrote to his old teacher.
As to the complaint of harsh criticism it may be remarked that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
Neefe, reared in the strict Leipsic school, must have been greatly
dissatisfied with the direction which the young genius was taking
under the influences which surrounded him, and that he should
labor to change its course. He was still a young man, and in
his zeal for his pupil’s progress may well have criticized his childish
compositions with a severity which, though no more than
just and reasonable, may have so contrasted with injudicious
praise from other quarters as to wound the boy’s self-esteem and
leave a sting behind; especially if Neefe indulged in a tone at all
contemptuous, a common fault of young men in like cases. Probably,
in some conversation upon this point Beethoven may have
remarked to Wegeler that Neefe had criticized him in his childhood
rather too severely.</p>

<p>But to return from the broad field of hypothesis to the narrow
path of facts. “On this day, June 20, 1782,” Neefe writes of himself
and the Grossmann company, “we entered upon our journey
to Münster, whither the Elector also went. The day before my
predecessor, Court Organist van den Eeden, was buried; I received
permission, however, to leave my duties in the hands of
a vicar and go along to Westphalia and thence to the Michaelmas
fair at Frankfort.” The Düsseldorf documents prove that this
vicar was Ludwig van Beethoven, now just eleven and a half
years of age. In the course of the succeeding winter, Neefe prepared
that very valuable and interesting communication to
“Cramer’s Magazine” which has been so largely quoted. In
this occurs the first printed notice of Beethoven, one which is
honorable to head and heart of its author. He writes, under
date of March 2, 1783:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Louis van Beethoven, son of the tenor singer mentioned, a boy of
eleven years and of most promising talent. He plays the clavier very
skilfully and with power, reads at sight very well, and&mdash;to put it in a
nutshell&mdash;he plays chiefly “The Well-Tempered Clavichord” of Sebastian
Bach, which Herr Neefe put into his hands. Whoever knows this collection
of preludes and fugues in all the keys&mdash;which might almost be called
the <i>non plus ultra</i> of our art&mdash;will know what this means. So far as his
duties permitted, Herr Neefe has also given him instruction in thorough-bass.
He is now training him in composition and for his encouragement
has had nine variations for the pianoforte, written by him on a march&mdash;by
Ernst Christoph Dressler&mdash;engraved at Mannheim. This youthful
genius is deserving of help to enable him to travel. He would surely
become a second Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart were he to continue as he
has begun.</p></div>

<p>This allusion to Mozart, who had not then produced those
immortal works upon which his fame now principally rests, speaks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
well for the insight of Neefe and renders his high appreciation of
his pupil’s genius the more striking. Had this man then really
so little influence upon its development as Wegeler supposed?</p>

<p>That C. P. E. Bach’s works were included in Neefe’s course
of instruction is rendered nearly certain by the following facts:
he was himself a devout student of them; the only reference to
his father made by Beethoven in all the manuscripts examined
for this work, an official document or two excepted, is upon an
unfinished copy of one of Bach’s cantatas in these words: “Written
by my dear father;”<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> and one of the works most used by him in
compiling his “Materialien für Contrapunkt” in 1809 was Bach’s
“Versuch über die wahre Art das Clavier zu Spielen.” The unlucky
remark of Wegeler, founded, too, possibly upon some expression
of Beethoven’s in a moment of spleen, but certainly not
in justice, has cast a shadow upon the relation between Neefe
and his pupil. Writer after writer has copied without examining
it. Does it bear examination? Possibly, if it be supposed to
relate only to execution upon the pianoforte and organ; but in
no other case. It is self-evident that serious study in the severe
school of the Bachs was necessary to counteract the influence of
the light and trivial music of the Bonn stage upon the young
genius; and to Neefe the credit of seeing this and acting accordingly
must be given. The reader’s attention is called particularly
to the words “He is now training him in composition, and
for his encouragement has had nine variations for the pianoforte
written by him on a march by Dressler engraved at Mannheim,”
in Neefe’s notice of Beethoven above cited, and the date of the
article from which it is taken&mdash;March 2, 1783. Is it not perfectly
clear that these variations have been recently composed,
and very recently printed? Yet upon the title stands, “Par un
jeune amateur, Louis van Beethoven, âgé de dix ans.” If this
were a solitary case of apparent discrepancy between the boy’s
age and the year given it would attract and deserve no notice;
but it is one of many and adds its weight to the evidence of that
falsification already spoken of.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

<p>A second work belonging to this period is a two-part fugue in
D for the organ.<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Beethoven as Neefe’s Assistant</span></div>

<p>To return to the young organist, who, since the publication
of Wegeler’s “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Notizen</span>,” has always been supposed to have been
placed at that instrument by the Elector Max Franz in the year
1785, as a method of giving him pecuniary aid without touching
his feelings of pride and independence. The place of assistant
to Neefe was no sinecure; although not involving much labor,
it brought with it much confinement. The old organ had been
destroyed by the fire of 1777, and a small chamber instrument still
supplied its place. It was the constantly recurring necessity of being
present at the religious services which made the position onerous.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>On all Sundays and regular festivals (says the Court Calendar)
high mass at 11 a.m. and vespers at 3 (sometimes 4) p.m. The vespers
will be sung throughout in <i>Capellis solemnibus</i> by the musicians of the
electoral court, the middle vespers will be sung by the court clergy and
musicians chorally as far as the <i>Magnificat</i>, which will be performed musically.
On all Wednesdays in Lent the <i>Miserere</i> will be sung by the chapel
at 5 p.m. and on all Fridays the <i>Stabat mater</i>. Every Saturday at
3 p.m. the Litanies at the altar of Our Lady of Loretto. Every day
throughout the year two masses will be read, the one at 9, the other at
11&mdash;on Sundays the latter at 10.</p></div>

<p>Such a programme gave the organist something at least to do,
and when Neefe left Bonn for Münster, June 20, 1782, he left his
pupil no easy task. Before the close of the theatrical season of
the next winter (1782-’83) the master was obliged to call upon the
boy for still farther assistance. “In the winter of 1784,” writes
the widow Neefe, “my husband of blessed memory was temporarily
entrusted with the direction of the church music as well as
other music at court while the Electoral Chapelmaster L. was
absent on a journey of several months.” The date is wrong, for
Lucchesi’s petition for leave of absence was granted April 26, 1783.
Thus overwhelmed with business, Neefe could no longer conduct
at the pianoforte the rehearsals for the stage, and Ludwig van<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
Beethoven, now 12 years old, became also “cembalist in the
orchestra.” In those days every orchestra was provided with a
harpsichord or pianoforte, seated at which the director guided
the performance, playing from the score. Here, then, was in
part the origin of that marvellous power, with which in later
years Beethoven astonished his contemporaries, of reading and
playing the most difficult and involved scores at first sight. The
position of cembalist was one of equal honor and responsibility.
Handel and Matthison’s duel grew out of the fact that the former
would not leave the harpsichord on a certain occasion before the
close of the performance. Gassmann placed the young Salieri
at the harpsichord of the Imperial Opera House as the best possible
means of training him to become the great conductor that
he was. This was the high place of honor given to Haydn when
in London. In Ludwig van Beethoven’s case it was the place in
which he, as Mosel says of Salieri, “could make practical use of
what he learned from books and scores at home.” Moreover,
it was a place in which he could, even in boyhood, hear to satiety
the popular Italian, French and German operas of the day and
learn to feel that something higher and nobler was necessary to
touch the deeper feelings of the heart; a place which, had the
Elector lived ten years longer, might have given the world another
not merely great but prolific, nay inexhaustible, operatic composer.
The cembalist’s duties doubtless came to an end with the departure
of the Elector for Münster in May or June, and he then had
time for other pursuits, of which composition was one. A song,
“<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Schilderung eines Mädchens</span>,” by him was printed this year in
Bossler’s “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Blumenlese für Liebhaber</span>,” and a Rondo in C for
pianoforte, anonymous, which immediately follows, was also of
his composition. A more important work, which before the close
of the year was published by Bossler with a magniloquent dedication
to Max Friedrich, was the three sonatas for pianoforte,
according to the title, if true, “composed by Ludwig van Beethoven,
aged 11 years.”<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> The reader can judge whether or not
the 11 should be 12.</p>

<p>To turn for a moment to the Beethoven family matters.
This summer (1783) had brought them some sorrow again. The
child Franz Georg, now just two and a half years old, died<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
August 16th. This was another stroke of bad fortune which not
only wounded the heart but added to the pecuniary difficulties
of the father, who was now losing his voice and whose character
is described in an official report made the next summer by the
words “of tolerable conduct.” If the duties of Neefe during
the last season had been laborious, in the coming one, 1783-’84,
they were still more arduous. It was the first under the new
contract by which the Elector assumed all the costs of the theatre,
and a woman, Mme. Grossmann, had the direction. It was all-important
to singers, actors and whoever was concerned that the
result of the experiment should be satisfactory to their employer;
and as the opera was more to his taste than the spoken drama, so
much the more difficult was Neefe’s task. Besides his acting
as chapelmaster in the place of Lucchesi, still absent, there was
“every forenoon rehearsal of opera,” as Mme. Grossmann wrote
to Councillor T., at which, of course, Neefe had to be present.
There was ever new music to be examined, arranged, copied,
composed&mdash;what not?&mdash;all which he must attend to; in short, he
had everything to do which could be imposed upon a theatrical
music director with a salary of 1,000 florins. It therefore became
a busy time for his young assistant, who still had no recognition
as member of the court chapel, not even as “accessist”&mdash;the last
“accessist” organist was Meuris (1778)&mdash;and consequently no
salary from the court. But he had now more than completed
the usual year of probation to which candidates were subjected,
and his talents and skill were well enough known to warrant his
petition for an appointment. The petition has not been discovered;
but the report made upon it to the privy council has
been preserved, together with the following endorsement: “High
Lord Steward Count von Salm, referring to the petition of Ludwig
van Beethoven for the position of Assistant Court Organist, is
of the humble opinion that the grace ought to be bestowed upon
him, together with a small compensation.” This endorsement is
dated “Bonn, February 29, 1784.” The report upon the petition
is as follows:</p>

</p>

<p>The necessity of the case, the warm recommendation of
Salm-Reifferscheid, very probably, too, the Elector’s own knowledge
of the fitness of the candidate, and perhaps the flattery in
the dedication of the sonatas&mdash;for these were the days when dedications
but half disguised petitions for favor&mdash;were sufficient
inducements to His Transparency at length to confirm the young
organist in the position which Neefe’s kindness had now for nearly
two years given him. Opinions differ as to the precise meaning
of the word <i>Beruhet</i> (translated “granted” in the above transcripts);
but this much is certain: Beethoven was not appointed
assistant organist in 1785 by Max Franz at the instance of Count
Waldstein, but at the age of 13 in the spring of 1784 by Max
Friedrich, and upon his own petition supported by the influence
of Neefe and of Salm-Reifferscheid.</p>

<p>The appointment was made, but the salary had not been
determined on when an event occurred which wrought an entire
change in the position of theatrical affairs at Bonn:&mdash;the Elector
died on April 15, and the theatrical company was dismissed
with four weeks’ wages. There was no longer a necessity for
a second organist; and fortunate it was for the assistant that
his name came before Max Friedrich’s successor (in the reports
soon to be copied) as being a regular member of the court chapel,
although “without salary.” Lucchesi returned to Bonn; Neefe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
had nothing to do but play his organ, cultivate his garden outside
the town and give music lessons. It was long before such a conjunction
of circumstances occurred as would have led the economical
Max Franz to appoint an organist adjunct. Happy was it,
therefore, that one of the deceased Elector’s last acts secured
young Beethoven the place.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Early Efforts at Composition</span></div>

<p>The excellent Frau Karth, born in 1780, could not recall to
memory any period of her childhood down to the death of Johann
van Beethoven, when he and his family did not live in the lodging
above that of her parents. This fact, together with the circumstance
that no mention is made of the Beethovens in the account
of the great inundation of the Rhine in February, 1782, when all
the families dwelling in the Fischer house of the Rheingasse were
rescued in boats from the windows of the first story, added to the
strong probability that Beethoven’s position was but the first
formal step of the regular process of confirming an appointment
already determined upon;&mdash;these points strongly suggest the idea
that to Ludwig’s advancement his father owed the ability to
dwell once more in a better part of the town, i.e., in the pleasant

<p>Maria Theresia&mdash;Appearance and Character of Elector
Max Franz&mdash;Musical Culture in the Austrian Imperial
Family&mdash;A Royal Violinist&mdash;His Admiration for
Mozart&mdash;His Court Music.</p></div>


<div class="blockquot">

<p>Maria Theresia was a tender mother, much concerned to see all her
children well provided for in her lifetime and as independent as possible
of her eldest son, the heir to the throne. This wish had already been
fulfilled in the case of several of them.... The youngest son, Maximilian
(born in Vienna, December 8, 1756), was already chosen coadjutor
to his paternal uncle, Duke Karl of Lorraine, Grand Master of the Teutonic
Order. But to provide a more bountiful and significant support,
Prince Kaunitz formulated a plan which pleased the maternal heart of
the monarch, and whose execution was calculated to extend the influence
of the Court of Vienna in the German Empire. It was to bestow more
ecclesiastical principalities upon the Archduke Maximilian. His eyes
fell first upon the Archbishopric and Electorate of Cologne and the Archbishopric
and Principality of Münster. These two countries had one
and the same Regent, Maximilian Friedrich, descended from the Suabian
family of Königseck-Rothenfels, Counts of the Empire. In view of the
advanced age of this ruler his death did not seem far distant; but it was
thought best not to wait for that contingency, but to secure the right of
succession at once by having the Archduke elected Coadjutor in Cologne
and Münster. Their possession was looked upon as a provision worthy
of the son of an Empress-Queen. As Elector and Lord of the Rhenish
shore, simultaneously co-director of the Westphalian Circuit (a dignity
associated with the archbishopric of Münster), he could be useful to his
house, and oppose the Prussian influence in the very part of Germany
where it was largest.</p></div>

<p>Thus Dohm begins the seventh chapter of his “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Denkwürdigkeiten</span>”
where, in a calm and passionless style, he relates the
history of the intrigues and negotiations which ended in the
election of Maria Theresia’s youngest son on August 7, 1780, as
coadjutor to the Elector of Cologne and, on the 16th of the same
month, to that of Münster, and secured him the peaceful and immediate
succession when Max Friedrich’s functions should cease.
The news of the election at Cologne reached Bonn on the same
day about 1 o’clock p. m. The Elector proceeded at once to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
Church of the Franciscans (used as the chapel since the conflagration
of 1777), where a “musical ‘Te Deum’” was sung, while all
the city bells were ringing. Von Kleist’s regiment fired a triple
salvo, which the cannon on the city walls answered. At noon a
public dinner was spread in the palace, one table setting 54, another
24 covers. In the evening at 8&frac12; o’clock, followed the finest
illumination ever seen in Bonn, which the Elector enjoyed riding
about in his carriage. After this came a grand supper of 82 covers,
then a masked ball “to which every decently clad subject as well
as any stranger was admitted, and which did not come to an end
till nearly 7 o’clock.”</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Max Franz, the New Elector</span></div>

<p>Max Franz was in his twenty-eighth year when he came to
Bonn. He was of middle stature, strongly built and already
inclining to that corpulence which in his last years made him a
prodigy of obesity. If all the absurdities of his eulogists be taken
for truth, the last Elector of Cologne was endowed with every
grace of mind and character that ever adorned human nature.
In fact, however, he was a good-looking, kindly, indolent, somewhat
choleric man; fond of a joke; affable; a hater of stiff ceremony;
easy of access; an honest, amiable, conscientious ruler,
who had the wisdom and will to supply his own deficiencies with
enlightened and skilful ministers, and the good sense to rule,
through their political foresight and sagacity, with an eye as
much to the interests of his subjects as his own.</p>

<p>In his boyhood he was rather stupid. Swinburne dismisses
him in two lines: “Maximilian is a good-natured, neither here-nor-there
kind of youth.” The brilliant, witty, shrewdly observant
Mozart wrote to his father (Nov. 17, 1781): “To whom God gives
an office he also gives an understanding. This is really the case
with the Archduke. Before he became a priest he was much
wittier and more intellectual and talked less, but more sensibly.
You ought to see him now! Stupidity looks out of his eyes; he
talks eternally, always in falsetto; he has a swollen neck&mdash;in a
word, the man is completely transformed.” His mother had
supplied him with the best instructors that Vienna afforded, and
had sent him travelling pretty extensively for an archduke in
those days. One of his journeys was to visit his sister Marie
Antoinette in Paris, where his awkwardness and breaches of etiquette
caused as much amusement to the anti-Austrian party as
they did annoyance to the Queen, and afterwards to his brother
Joseph, when they came to his ears.</p>

<p>In 1778 he was with Joseph in the campaign in Bavaria. An
injury to his knee, caused by a fall of his horse, is the reason alleged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
for his abandonment of a military career; upon which he was
prevailed upon, so the “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Historisches Taschenbuch</span>” (II, Vienna,
1806) expresses it, to become a candidate for the Coadjutorship
of Cologne. If he had to be “prevailed upon” to enter the church,
the more to his credit was the course he pursued when once his
calling and election were sure.</p>

<p>The rigid economy which he introduced at court immediately
after his accession in 1784 gave rise to the impression that he was
penurious. It may be said in his defence that the condition of
the finances required retrenchment and reform; that he was
simple in his tastes and cared nothing for show and magnificence,
except upon occasions when, in his opinion, the electoral dignity
required them. Then, like his predecessors, he was lavish. His
personal expenses were not great, and he waited until his revenues
justified it before he indulged to any great extent his passion
for the theatre, music and dancing (stout as he was, he was a
passionate dancer), and his table. He was, through the nature
of his physical constitution, an enormous eater, though his drink
was only water.</p>

<p>The influence of a ruler upon the tone and character of society
in a small capital is very great. A change for the better had begun
during the time of Max Friedrich, but under his successor a new
life entered Bonn. New objects of ambition were offered to the
young men. The church and cloister ceased to be all in all. One
can well understand how Wegeler in his old age, as he looked back
half a century to the years when he was student and professor&mdash;and
<i>such</i> a half-century, with its revolutionary and Napoleonic
wars, its political, religious and social changes!&mdash;should write
(“<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Notizen</span>,” p. 59): “In fact, it was a beautiful and in many ways
active period in Bonn, so long as the genial Elector, Max Franz,
Maria Theresia’s youngest son and favorite, reigned there.”
How strongly the improved tone of society impressed itself upon
the characters of the young is discernible in the many of them
who, in after years, were known as men of large and liberal ideas
and became distinguished as jurists, theologians and artists, or
in science and letters. These were the years of Beethoven’s youth
and early manhood; and though his great mental powers were in
the main exercised upon his art, there is still to be observed
through all his life a certain breadth and grandeur in his intellectual
character, owing in part, no doubt, to the social influences
under which it was developed.</p>

<p>It is highly honorable to the young Max Franz that he refused
to avail himself of a privilege granted him in a Papal bull<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
obtained for him by his mother&mdash;that of deferring the assumption
of priestly vows for a period of ten years&mdash;but chose rather,
as soon as he had leisure for the step, to enter the seminary in
Cologne to fit himself for consecration. He entered November
29, rigidly submitted himself to all the discipline of the institution
for the period of eight days, when, on December 8, the nuntius,
Bellisoni, ordained him sub-deacon; after another eight days, on
the 16th, deacon; and on the 21st, priest; thus showing that if
there be no royal road to mathematics, there is a railway with express
train for royal personages in pursuit of ecclesiastical science.
Returning to Bonn, he read his first mass on Christmas eve in
the Florian Chapel.</p>

<p>The cause of science and education the Elector had really
at heart. In 1785 he had established a botanic garden; now he
opened a public reading room in the palace library and sent a
message to the theological school in Cologne, that if the improved
course of instruction adopted in Austria was not introduced,
he should found other seminaries. On the 26th of June he was
present at the opening of a normal school; and on August 9th
came the decree raising the Bonn Hochschule to the rank of a
university by authority of an Imperial diploma.</p>

<p>Upon the suppression of the Jesuits in 1774, Max Friedrich
devoted their possessions and revenues to the cause of education.
New professorships were established in the gymnasium and in
1777 an “Academy” was formed. This was the first step; the
second was to found an independent institution called the Lyceum;
and at his death an application was before the Emperor for a
university charter. Max Franz pushed the matter, obtained the
charter from his brother, and Monday, the 20th of November,
1786, was the day appointed for the solemn inauguration of the
new institution. The Court Calendar for the next year names
six professors of theology, six of jurisprudence, civil and ecclesiastical,
four of medicine, and ten of philology and other branches of
learning. In later editions new names are added; in that of
1790, Wegeler is professor of midwifery.</p>

<p>Though economical, Max Franz drew many a man of superior
abilities&mdash;men of letters and artists&mdash;to Bonn; and but for
the bursting of the storm which was even then gathering over the
French border, his little capital might well have had a place in
German literary history not inferior to that of Weimar. Nor are
instances wanting in which he gave generous aid to young talent
struggling with poverty; though that he did so much for Beethoven
as is usually thought is, at least, doubtful.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<p>This man, not a genius, not overwhelmingly great mentally,
nor, on the other hand, so stupid as the stories told of his boyhood
seem to indicate, but honest, well-meaning, ready to adopt
and enforce wise measures devised by skilful ministers; easy,
jocose and careless of appearances, very fond of music and a
patron of letters and science,&mdash;this man, to whom in that period
of vast intellectual fermentation the Index Expurgatorius was
a dead letter, gave the tone to Bonn society.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">A Gifted Imperial Family</span></div>

<p>That solid musical education which she had received from
her father, Maria Theresia bestowed upon her children, and their
attainments in the art seem to have justified the time and labor
spent. In 1749, at the age of seven and six, Christina and Maria
Elizabeth took part in one of the festive musical pieces; Marie
Antoinette was able to appreciate Gluck and lead the party in
his favor in later years at Paris. Joseph is as much known in
musical as in civil and political history. When Emperor he had
his daily hour of music in his private apartments, playing either
of several instruments or singing, according to the whim of the
moment; and Maximilian, the youngest, acquired a good degree
of skill both in singing and in the treatment of his favorite instrument,
the viola. Beethoven once told Schindler that the
Elector thought very highly of Mattheson. In his reminiscences
of a visit to Vienna in 1783, J. F. Reichardt gives high praise to
the musical interest, skill and zeal of Emperor Joseph and his
brother Archduke Maximilian, and a writer in “Cramer’s Magazine,”
probably Neefe, tells of a “remarkable concert” which
took place at court in Bonn on April 5, 1786, at which the
Elector played the viola, Duke Albrecht the violin, “and the fascinating
Countess Belderbusch the clavier most charmingly.”</p>

<p>Maximilian had become personally acquainted with Mozart
in Salzburg in 1775, where the young composer had set Metastasio’s
“Il Re pastore” to music to be performed in his honor
(April 23rd); from which time, to his credit be it said, he ever
held the composer and his music in kindest remembrance. When
in 1781 Mozart determined to leave his brutal Archbishop of
Salzburg and remain in Vienna, the Archduke showed at all events
a desire to aid him.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Yesterday (writes the composer November 17, 1781) the Archduke
Maximilian summoned me to him at 3 o’clock in the afternoon.
When I entered he was standing before a stove in the first room
awaiting me. He came towards me and asked if I had anything to do
to-day? “Nothing, Your Royal Highness, and if I had it would always
be a grace to wait upon Your Royal Highness.” “No; I do not wish to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
constrain anyone.” Then he said that he was minded to give a concert
in the evening for the Court of Wurtemberg. Would I play something
and accompany the aria? I was to come to him again at 6 o’clock. So I
played there yesterday.</p>

<p>Mozart was everything to him (continues Jahn); he signalized him
at every opportunity and said, if he were Elector of Cologne, Mozart
would surely be his chapelmaster. He had also suggested to the Princess
(of Wurtemberg) that she appoint Mozart her music teacher, but received
the reply that if it rested with her she would have chosen him; but the
Emperor&mdash;“for him there is nobody but Salieri!” cries out Mozart peevishly&mdash;had
recommended Salieri because of the singing, and she had to
take him, for which she was sorry.</p></div>

<p>Jahn gives no reason why Mozart was not engaged for Bonn.
Perhaps he would have been had Lucchesi resigned in consequence
of the reduction of his salary; but he kept his office of chapelmaster
and could not well be dismissed without cause. Mattioli’s
resignation was followed by the call of Joseph Reicha to the place
of concertmaster; but for Mozart no vacancy occurred at that
time. Maximilian was in Vienna during most of the month of
October, 1785, and may have desired to secure Mozart in some
way, but just at that time the latter was, as his father wrote,
“over head and ears busy with the opera ‘Le Nozze di Figaro.’”
Old Chapelmaster Bono could not live much longer; which gave
him hope, should the opera succeed, of obtaining a permanent
appointment in Vienna; and, in short, his prospects seemed
just then so good that his determination&mdash;if he should really receive
an offer from the Elector&mdash;to remain in the great capital rather
than to take his young wife so far away from home and friends
as the Rhine then was, and, in a manner, bury himself in a small
town where so few opportunities would probably be given him
for the exercise of the vast powers which he was conscious of
possessing, need not surprise us.</p>

<p>Was it the good or the ill fortune of the boy Beethoven that
Mozart came not to Bonn? His marvellous original talents were
thus left to be developed without the fostering care of one of the
very greatest of musical geniuses, and one of the profoundest
of musical scholars; but on the other hand it was not oppressed,
perhaps crushed, by daily intercourse with that genius and
scholarship.</p>

<p>Maximilian, immediately after reaching Bonn as Elector,
ordered full and minute reports to be made out concerning all
branches of the administration, of the public and court service
and of the cost of their maintenance. Upon these reports were
based his arrangements for the future. Those relating to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
court music are too important and interesting to be overlooked,
for they give us details which carry us instantly into the circle
which young Beethoven has just entered and in which, through
his father’s connection with it, he must from earliest childhood
have moved. They are three in number, the first being a list
of all the individuals constituting the court chapel; the second a
detailed description of the singers and players, together with estimates
of their capabilities; the third consists of recommendations
touching a reduction in salaries. A few paragraphs may be
presented here as most intimately connected with significant
personages in our history; they are combined and given in abstract
from the first two documents. Among the tenors we find</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Father and Son in the Court Chapel</span></div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>J. van Beethoven, age 44, born in Bonn, married; his wife is 32
years old, has three sons living in the electorate, aged 13, 10 and 8 years,
who are studying music, has served 28 years, salary 315 fl. “His voice
has long been stale, has been long in the service, very poor, of fair deportment
and married.”</p></div>

<p>Among the organists:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Christian Gottlob Neefe, aged 36, born at Chemnitz; married, his
wife is 32, has served 3 years, was formerly chapelmaster with Seiler;
salary 400 fl. “Christian Neffe, the organist, in my humble opinion
might well be dismissed, inasmuch as he is not particularly versed on the
organ, moreover is a foreigner, having no <i>Meritten</i> whatever and of the
Calvinistic religion.”</p>

<p>Ludwig van Beethoven, aged 13, born at Bonn, has served 2 years,
no salary. “Ludwig Betthoven, a son of the Betthoven sub No. 8, has
no salary, but during the absence of the chapelmaster Luchesy he played
the organ; is of good capability, still young, of good and quiet deportment
and poor.”</p></div>

<p>One of the items of the third report, proposing reductions of
salaries and removals, has a very special interest as proving that
an effort was made to supplant Neefe and give the post of court
organist to young Beethoven. It reads:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>Item.</i> If Neffe were to be dismissed another organist would have
to be appointed, who, if he were to be used only in the chapel could be had
for 150 florins, the same is small, young, and a son of a court <i>musici</i>, and
in case of need has filled the place for nearly a year very well.</p></div>

<p>The attempt to have Neefe dismissed from the service
failed, but a reduction of his salary to the pittance of 200 florins
had already led him to look about him to find an engagement for
himself and wife in some theatre, when Maximilian, having become
acquainted with his merits (notwithstanding his Calvinism),<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
restored his former allowance by a decree dated February 8,
1785. When Joseph Reicha came to Bonn in Mattioli’s place is
still undetermined with exactness; but a decree raising him from
the position of concertmaster to that of concert director, and
increasing his salary to 1,000 florins, bears date June 28, 1785.
In the general payroll of this year Reicha’s salary is stated to
be 666 thalers 52 alb., “tenorist Beethoven’s” 200 th., “Beethoven
jun.” 100 th.</p>

<p>Beethoven Again&mdash;The Young Organist&mdash;A First Visit to
Vienna&mdash;Death of Beethoven’s Mother&mdash;Sympathetic
Acquaintances&mdash;Dr. Wegeler’s “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Notizen</span>”&mdash;Some Questions

<p>Schindler records&mdash;and on such points his testimony is
good&mdash;that he had heard Beethoven attribute the marvellous
development of Mozart’s genius in great measure to the “consistent
instruction of his father,” thus implying his sense of the disadvantages
under which he himself labored from the want of regular
and systematic musical training through the period of his childhood
and youth.<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> It is, however, by no means certain that had
Ludwig van Beethoven been the son of Leopold Mozart, he would
ever have acquired that facility of expression which enabled
Wolfgang Mozart to fill up the richest and most varied scores
almost as rapidly as his pen could move, and so as hardly to need
correction&mdash;as if the development of musical idea was to him a
work of mere routine, or perhaps, better to say, of instinct. <i>Poeta
nascitur, non fit</i>, not only in respect to his thoughts but to his
power of clothing them in language. Many a man of profoundest
ideas can never by any amount of study and practice acquire
the art of conveying them in a lucid and elegant manner. On
the other hand there are those whose thoughts never rise above
the ordinary level, but whose essays are very models of style.
Handel said of the elder Telemann, that he could compose in
eight parts as easily as he (Handel) could write a letter; and
Handel’s own facility in composition was something astonishing.
Beethoven, on the contrary, as his original scores prove, earned
his bread by the sweat of his brow. But no amount of native
genius can compensate for the want of thorough training. If,
therefore, it be true that nature had in some degree limited his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
powers of expressing his musical as well as his intellectual ideas,
so much greater was the need that, at the age which he had now
reached, he should have opportunity to prosecute uninterruptedly
a more profound and systematic course of study. Hence, the
death of Maximilian Friedrich, which must have seemed to the
Beethovens at first a sad calamity, proved in the end a blessing
in disguise; for while it did not deprive the boy of the pecuniary
benefits of the position to which he had just been appointed, it
gave him two or three years of comparative leisure, uninterrupted
save by his share of the organist’s duties, for his studies,
which there is every reason to suppose he continued under the
guidance of his firm friend Neefe.</p>

<p>These three years were a period of theatrical inactivity in
Bonn. For the carnival season of 1785, the Elector engaged
Böhm and his company, then playing alternately at Cologne, Aix-la-Chapelle
and Düsseldorf. This troupe during its short season
may have furnished the young organist with valuable matter for
reflection, for in the list of newly studied pieces, from October
1783 to the same month 1785&mdash;thus including the engagement in
Bonn&mdash;are Gluck’s “Alceste” and “Orpheus,” four operas of
Salieri (the “Armida” among them), Sarti’s “Fra due Litiganti”
and “L’Incognito” in German translation, Holzbauer’s “Günther
von Schwarzburg” and five of Paisiello’s operas. These were,
says the report in the “Theater-Kalender” (1786), “in addition
to the old and familiar French operettas, ‘Zémire et Azor,’
‘Sylvain,’ ‘Lucile,’ ‘Der Prächtige,’ ‘Der Hausfreund,’ etc., etc.”
The three serious Vienna operas, “Alceste,” “Orpheus” and
“Armida,” in such broad contrast to the general character of the
stock pieces of the Rhenish companies, point directly to Maximilian
and the Bonn season. The elector of Hesse-Cassel, being
then in funds by the sale of his subjects to George III for the
American Revolutionary War just closed, supported a large
French theatrical company, complete in the three branches of
spoken and musical drama and ballet. Max Franz, upon his return
from Vienna in November, 1785, spent a few days in Cassel,
and, upon the death of the Elector and the dismissal of the actors,
a part of this company was engaged to play in Bonn during
January and February, 1786. The performances were thrice a
week, Monday, Wednesday and Saturday, and, with but two or
three exceptions, consisted of a comedy, followed by a light
opera or operetta. The list contains eight of Grétry’s compositions,
three by Desaides, two by Philidor, and one each by
Sacchini, Champein, Pergolesi, Gossec, Frizieri, Monsigny and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
Schwarzendorf (called Martini)&mdash;all of light and pleasing character,
and enjoying then a wide popularity not only in France but
throughout the Continent.</p>

<p>Meantime Grossmann had left Frankfort and with Klos,
previously a manager in Hamburg, had formed a new company
for the Cologne, Bonn and Düsseldorf stages. This troupe gave
the Carnival performances in 1787, confining them, so far as
appears, to the old round of familiar pieces.</p>

<p>Each of these companies had its own music director. With
Böhm was Mayer, composer of the “Irrlicht” and several ballets;
with the French company Jean Baptiste Rochefort was “music-master”;
and Grossmann had recently engaged Burgmüller, of
the Bellomo company, composer of incidental music for
“Macbeth.” Hence, during these years, Neefe’s public duties
extended no farther than his service as organist, for Lucchesi and
Reicha relieved him from all the responsibilities of the church
and concert-room.</p>

<p>That the organ service was at this time in part performed by
the assistant organist is a matter of course; there is also an anecdote,
related by Wegeler on the authority of Franz Ries, which
proves it. On Tuesday, Friday and Saturday of Holy Week,
portions of the Lamentations of Jeremiah were included in the
chapel service, recited by a single voice, accompanied on the

chant tune.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">The Boy Organist Confounds a Singer</span></div>

<p>On one occasion, in the week ending March 27, 1785, the
vocalist was Ferdinand Heller, too good a musician to be easily
disconcerted, the accompanist Ludwig van Beethoven, now in
his fifteenth year. While the singer delivered the long passages
of the Latin text to the reciting note the accompanist might indulge
his fancy, restricted only by the solemnity fitted to the
service. Wegeler relates that Beethoven</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>asked the singer, who sat with unusual firmness in the tonal saddle, if he
would permit him to throw him out, and utilized the somewhat too readily
granted permission to introduce so wide an excursion in the accompaniment
while persistently striking the reciting note with his little finger,
that the singer got so bewildered that he could not find the closing cadence.
Father Ries, the first violinist, then Music Director of the Electoral
Chapel, still living, tells with details how Chapelmaster Lucchesi, who was
present, was astonished by Beethoven’s playing. In his first access of
rage Heller entered a complaint against Beethoven with the Elector,
who commanded a simpler accompaniment, although the spirited and
occasionally waggish young prince was amused at the occurrence.
Schindler adds that Beethoven in his last years remembered the circum<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>stance,
and said that the Elector had “reprimanded him very graciously
and forbidden such clever tricks in the future.”</p></div>

<p>The date is easily determined: In Holy Week, 1784, neither Maximilian
nor Lucchesi was in Bonn; in 1786 Beethoven’s skill would
no longer have astonished the chapelmaster. Of the other characteristic
anecdotes related of Beethoven’s youth there is not one
which belongs to this period (May, 1784-April, 1787), although
some have been attributed to it by previous writers.</p>

<p>Nothing is to be added to the record already made except
that, on the authority of Stephan von Breuning, the youth was
once a pupil of Franz Ries on the violin, which must have been
at this time; that, according to Wegeler, his composition of the
song “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Wenn Jemand eine Reise thut</span>”<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> fell in this period, and that
he wrote three pianoforte quartets, the original manuscript of
which bore the following title: “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Trois Quatuors pour Clavecin,
violino, viola e basso. 1785. Composé par (de L.) Louis van
Beethoven, âgé 13 ans</span>.”<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> The reader will remark and understand
the discrepancy here between the date and the author’s age.
Were these quartets intended for publication and for dedication to
Max Franz, as the sonatas had been for Max Friedrich? During
their author’s life they never saw the light, but their principal
themes, even an entire movement, became parts of future works.
They were published in 1832 by Artaria and appear as Nos. 75
and 77, Series 10, in the Complete Works.</p>

<p>One family event is recorded in the parish register of St.
Remigius&mdash;the baptism of Maria Margaretha Josepha, daughter
of Johann van Beethoven, on May 5, 1786.</p>

<p>There is a letter from Bonn, dated April 8, 1787, in “Cramer’s
Magazine” (II, 1385), which contains a passing allusion to Beethoven.
It affords another glimpse of the musical life there:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Our residence city is becoming more and more attractive for music-lovers
through the gracious patronage of our beloved Elector. He has
a large collection of the most beautiful music and is expending much every
day to augment it. It is to him, too, that we owe the privilege of hearing
often virtuosi on various instruments. Good singers come seldom. The
love of music is increasing greatly among the inhabitants. The pianoforte
is especially liked; there are here several <i>Hammerclaviere</i> by Stein
of Augsburg, and other correspondingly good instruments....
The youthful Baron v. Gudenau plays the pianoforte right bravely,
and besides young Beethoven, the children of the chapelmaster deserve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
to be mentioned because of their admirable and precociously developed
talent. All of the sons of Herr v. Mastiaux play the clavier well, as
you already know from earlier letters of mine.</p></div>

<p>“This young genius deserves support to enable him to travel,”
wrote Neefe in 1783. In the springtime of 1787 the young “genius”
was at length enabled to travel. Whence or how he obtained
the means to defray the expenses of his journey, whether
aided by the Elector or some other Mæcenas, or dependent upon
the small savings from his salary and&mdash;hardly possible&mdash;from the
savings from his music lessons painfully and carefully hoarded for
the purpose, does not appear. The series of papers at Düsseldorf
is at this point broken; so that not even the petition for leave
of absence has been discovered. The few indications bearing
on this point are that he had no farther aid from the Elector than
the continued payment of his salary. What is certain is that the
youth, now sixteen, but passing for a year or two younger, visited
Vienna, where he received a few lessons from Mozart (Ries, in
“<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Notizen</span>,” page 86); that his stay was short, and that on his way
home he was forced to borrow some money in Augsburg.</p>

<p>When he made the journey is equally doubtful. Schindler
was told by some old acquaintances of Beethoven “that on the
visit two persons only were deeply impressed upon the lifelong
memory of the youth of sixteen years: the Emperor Joseph and
Mozart.” If the young artist really had an interview with the
Emperor it must have occurred before the 11th of April, or after
the 30th of June, for those were the days which began and ended
Joseph’s absence from Vienna upon his famous tour to the Crimea
with the Russian Empress Catharine; if before that absence, then
Beethoven was at least three months in the Austrian capital and
had left Bonn before the date of Neefe’s letter to “Cramer’s Magazine”;
in which case how could the writer in speaking of his young
colleague have omitted all mention of the fact? How, too, could
so important a circumstance have been unknown to or forgotten
by Dr. Wegeler and have found no place in his “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Notizen</span>,” which
moreover, were prepared under the eyes of both Franz Ries and
Madame von Breuning? It will soon be seen that Beethoven
was again in Bonn before July 17&mdash;a date which admits the bare
possibility of the reported meeting with Joseph after his return
from Russia.</p>

<p>If an opinion, which, indeed, is little more than a conjecture,
may be hazarded in relation with this visit, it is this: that if at
any time the missing archives of Maximilian’s court should come
to light it will be found that not until after the busy week for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
organists and chapelmusicians ending with Easter was leave of
absence granted to Beethoven; and that, too, with no farther
pecuniary aid from the Elector than possibly a quarter or two of
his salary in advance. In 1787, Easter Monday fell upon the 9th
of April, the day after the date of Neefe’s letter. Making due
allowance of time for the necessary preparations for so important
a journey, as in those days it was from Bonn to Vienna, it may be
reasonably conjectured that some time in May the youth reached
the latter city.</p>

<p>Let another conjecture find place here: it is that Johann van
Beethoven had not yet abandoned the hope of deriving pecuniary
profit from the precocity of his son’s genius; that he still
expected the boy, after replacing his hard organ-style of playing
by one more suited to the character of the pianoforte, to make
his dream of a wonder-child in some degree a reality. Hence&mdash;at
what fearful cost to the father in his poverty we know not&mdash;Ludwig
is sent to the most admirable pianist, the best teacher
then living, Mozart.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Beethoven’s Introduction to Mozart</span></div>

<p>But enough of conjecture. The oft-repeated anecdote of
Beethoven’s introduction to Mozart is stripped by Prof. Jahn of
Seyfried’s superlatives and related in these terms:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Beethoven, who as a youth of great promise came to Vienna
in 1786 (?)<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>, but was obliged to return to Bonn after a brief sojourn,
was taken to Mozart and at that musician’s request played something
for him which he, taking it for granted that it was a show-piece
prepared for the occasion, praised in a rather cool manner. Beethoven
observing this, begged Mozart to give him a theme for improvization.
He always played admirably when excited and now he was
inspired, too, by the presence of the master whom he reverenced greatly;
he played in such a style that Mozart, whose attention and interest grew
more and more, finally went silently to some friends who were sitting in
an adjoining room, and said, vivaciously, “Keep your eyes on him; some
day he will give the world something to talk about.”</p></div>

<p>Ries (“<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Notizen</span>,” p. 86) merely says: “During his visit to
Vienna he received some instruction from Mozart, but the latter,
as Beethoven lamented, never played for him.” Contrary to
the conjecture above mentioned as to Johann van Beethoven’s
object in sending his son to Vienna, it seems, from the connection
in which Ries introduces this remark, that the instruction given
by Mozart to the youth was confined to composition. The lessons
given were few&mdash;a fact which accounts for the circumstance that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
no member of Mozart’s family in after years, when Beethoven
had become world-renowned, has spoken of them.</p>

<p>If it be considered that poor Mozart lost his beloved father
on May 28, 1787, and that his mind was then fully occupied with
his new operatic subject, “Don Giovanni,” it will not be thought
strange that he did not exhibit his powers as a pianist to a youth
just beginning with him a course of study in composition, especially
as the pupil, in his eyes, was a little, undersized boy of 14&mdash;as
there is every reason to believe. That pupil’s power of handling
a theme, since Mozart probably knew nothing of his five years’
practice at the organ and in the theatre, may well have surprised
him; but in execution as a pianist he probably stood far, far below
the master when at the same age, below the little Hummel (at that
very time an inmate of Mozart’s family), and certainly below
Cesarius Scheidl (forgotten name!) aged ten, who had played a
pianoforte concerto between the parts of an oratorio no longer
ago than the preceding 22nd of December in the grand concert
of the “Society of Musicians.” Had not Beethoven’s visit been
so abruptly, unexpectedly and sorrowfully brought to an end, he
would, doubtless, have had nothing to regret on the score of his
master’s playing.</p>

<p>In some written talks to Beethoven in the years of his deafness,
still preserved, are found two allusions at least made by his nephew
to this personal acquaintance with Mozart. In the first case the
words are these: “You knew Mozart; where did you see him?”
In the other, two or three years later: “Was Mozart a good pianoforte
player? It was then still in its infancy.” Of course Beethoven’s
replies are wanting; and herewith is exhausted all that,
during the researches for this work, has been found relating to
his first visit in Vienna. The Vienna newspapers of the time
contained notices of the “wonder-children” Hummel and Scheidl,
but none whatever of Beethoven.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Acquaintances in Augsburg</span></div>

<p>That the youth in passing through Augsburg must have become
acquainted with the pianoforte-maker Stein and his family
is self-evident. There is something in a conversation-book which
seems to prove this, and also to add evidence to the falsification
of his age. It is this: in the spring of 1824 Andreas Streicher and
his wife&mdash;the same Stein’s “Mädl”&mdash;whose appearance at the
pianoforte when a child of eight and a half years is so piquantly
described by Mozart, called upon Beethoven on their way from
Vienna into the country. A few sentences of the conversation,
written in the hand of the composer’s nephew, are preserved. The
topic for a time is the packing of movables and Beethoven’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
removal into country lodgings for the summer; and at length they
come upon the instruments manufactured by Streicher; after
which Carl writes: “Frau von Streicher says that she is delighted
that at 14 years of age you saw the instruments made by her father
and now see those of her son.” True, it may be said that this refers
to Beethoven’s knowledge of the Stein “Hammerclaviere” then
in Bonn; but to any one thoroughly conversant with the subject
these words are, like Iago’s “trifles light as air,” confirmation
strong of the other view. His introduction to the family of the
advocate Dr. Schaden in Augsburg, is certain. Reichardt was
in that city in 1790 and wrote of Frau Nanette von Schaden as
being of all the women he knew, those of Paris not excepted, far
and away the greatest pianoforte player, not excelled perhaps,
by any virtuoso in skill and certainty; also a singer with much
expression and excellent declamation&mdash;“in every respect an amiable
and interesting woman.” The earliest discovered letter of
Beethoven to Schaden, and dated Bonn, September 15, 1787,
proves the friendship of the Schadens for him and fully explains
the causes of his sudden departure from Vienna and the abrupt
termination of his studies with Mozart.</p>

<p>I can easily imagine what you must think of me, and I can not deny
that you have good grounds for an unfavorable opinion. I shall not,
however, attempt to justify myself, until I have explained to you the
reasons why I hope my apologies will be accepted. I must tell you that
from the time I left Augsburg my cheerfulness as well as my health began
to decline; the nearer I came to my native city the more frequent were
the letters from my father urging me to travel with all possible speed, as
my mother was not in a favorable state of health. I therefore hurried
forward as fast as I could, although myself far from well. My longing
once more to see my dying mother overcame every obstacle and assisted
me in surmounting the greatest difficulties. I found my mother still
alive but in the most deplorable state; her disease was consumption, and
about seven weeks ago, after much pain and suffering, she died. She
was such a kind, loving mother to me, and my best friend. Ah, who was
happier than I when I could still utter the sweet name, mother, and it was
heard? And to whom can I now speak it? Only to the silent image
resembling her evoked by the power of the imagination. I have passed
very few pleasant hours since my arrival here, having during the whole
time been suffering from asthma, which may, I fear, eventually develop
into consumption; to this is added melancholy&mdash;almost as great an evil
as my malady itself. Imagine yourself in my place, and then I shall
hope to receive your forgiveness for my long silence. You showed me
extreme kindness and friendship by lending me three Carolins in Augsburg,
but I must entreat your indulgence for a time. My journey cost
me a great deal, and I have not the smallest hopes of earning anything
here. Fate is not propitious to me in Bonn.</p>

<p>Pardon my detaining you so long with my chatter; it was necessary

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Death of Beethoven’s Mother</span></div>

<p>The Bonn “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Intelligenzblatt</span>” supplies a pendant to this sad
letter:&mdash;“1787, July 17. Died, Maria Magdalena Koverich (<i>sic</i>),
named van Beethoven, aged 49 years.”<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> When Ferdinand Ries,
some thirteen years later, presented his father’s letter of introduction
to Beethoven in Vienna, the latter “read the letter through”
and said: “I cannot answer your father just now; but do you
write to him that I have not forgotten how my mother died. He
will be satisfied with that.” “Later,” adds Ries, “I learned that,
the family being greatly in need, my father had been helpful to
him on this occasion in every way.”</p>

<p>A petition of Johann van Beethoven, offered before the death
of his wife, describing his pitiable condition and asking aid from
the Elector, has not been discovered; but the substance of it is
found in a volume of “Geheime Staats-Protocolle” for 1787 in
form following:</p>
<div class="center">

and that he no longer knows what to do for his sick wife
and many children. He prays for the benefaction of an
advance of 100 rthlr. on his salary.</p></div></div></div>

<p>No record is found in the Düsseldorf archives of any grant
of aid to the distressed family; hence, so far as now appears, the
only successful appeal for assistance was made to Franz Ries, then
a young man of 32 years, who generously aided in “every way”
his unfortunate colleague. Where then was the Breuning family?
Where Graf Waldstein? To these questions the reply is that
Beethoven was still unknown to them&mdash;a reply which involves the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
utter rejection of the chronology adopted by Dr. Wegeler, in his
“<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Notizen</span>,” of that part of the composer’s life. This mistake, if
indeed it prove to be such, is one which has been adopted
without hesitation by all who have written upon the subject.
The reader here, for the first time, finds Wegeler’s account of
Beethoven’s higher intellectual development and his introduction
into a more refined social circle placed after, instead of before,
the visit to Vienna; and his introduction to the Breunings and
Waldstein dated at the time when the youth was developing
into the man, and not at a point upon the confines of childhood
and youth.</p>

<p>This demands some explanation.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Dr. Wegeler’s Chronology Corrected</span></div>

<p>The history of Beethoven’s Bonn life would be so sadly imperfect
without the “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Notizen</span>” of Dr. Wegeler, which bear in
every line such an impress of perfect candor and honesty, that
they can be read only with feelings of gratefullest remembrance
of their author and with fullest confidence in their authenticity.
But no more in his case than in others can the reminiscences of
an aged man be taken as conclusive evidence in regard to facts
and occurrences of years long since past, when opposed to contemporary
records, or involving confusion of dates. Some slight
lapse of memory, misapprehension, or unlucky adoption of another’s
mistake, may lead astray and be the abundant source of
error. Still, it is only with great diffidence and extreme caution
that one can undertake to correct an original authority so trustworthy
as Dr. Wegeler. Such corrections must be made, however;
for only by this can many a difficulty be removed. An error in
the Doctor’s chronology might easily be occasioned by the long
accepted false date of Beethoven’s birth, insensibly influencing
his recollections; and certainly when Dr. Wegeler, Madame von
Breuning and Franz Ries, all alike venerable in years as in character,
sit together discussing in 1837-8 occurrences of 1785-8,
with nothing to aid their memories or control their reminiscences
but an old Court Calendar or two, they may well to
some extent have confounded times and seasons in the vague
and misty distance of so many years; the more easily because
the error is one of but two or three years at most. Bearing
upon the point in question is the fact that Frau Karth&mdash;who
distinctly remembers the death of Madame van Beethoven&mdash;has
no recollections of the young Breunings and Waldstein until after
that event.</p>

<p>Some words of Dr. Wegeler in an unprinted letter to Beethoven
(1825): “inasmuch as the house of my mother-in-law was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
more your domicile than your own, especially after you lost your
noble mother,” seem to favor the usually accepted chronology:
but if Beethoven was thus almost a member of the Breuning
family as early as 1785 or 1786, how can the tone of the letter to
Dr. Schaden be explained? Or how account for the fact, that,
when he reached Bonn again and found his mother dying, and
his father “in a very unfortunate state” and “compelled to sell a
portion of his effects and pawn others and knew not what to do,”
it was to Franz Ries he turned for aid? The good Doctor is certainly
mistaken as to the time when Beethoven found Mæcenases
in the Elector and Waldstein; why not equally so in relation to
the Breuning family?</p>

<p>If, now, his own account of his intimacy with the young
musician&mdash;given in the preface to the “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Notizen</span>”&mdash;be examined,
it will be found to strengthen what has just been said: “Born in
Bonn in 1765, I became acquainted in 1782 with the twelve years
old lad, who, however, was already known as an author, and lived
in most intimate association with him uninterruptedly until
September, 1787” (and still he could forget that friend’s absence
in Vienna only a few months before), “when, to finish my medical
studies, I visited the Vienna schools and institutions. After my
return in October, 1789, we continued to live together in an
equally cordial association until Beethoven’s later departure for
Vienna towards the close of 1792, whither I also emigrated in
October, 1794.”</p>

<p>For more than two years, then, and just at this period, Dr.
Wegeler was not in Bonn. Let still another circumstance be
noted: Nothing has been discovered, either in the “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Notizen</span>” or
elsewhere, which necessarily implies that Wegeler himself intimately
knew the Breunings until after his return from Vienna in
1789; moreover, in those days, when the distinctions of rank were
so strongly marked, it is, to say the least, exceedingly improbable,
that the son of an immigrant Alsatian shoemaker should have
obtained entrée upon the supposed terms of intimacy in a household
in which the oldest child was some six years younger than
himself, and which belonged to the highest social, if not titled
rank, until he by the force of his talents, culture, and high character,
had risen to its level. That, after so rising, the obscurity
of his birth was forgotten and the only daughter became his wife,
is alike honorable to both parties. It is unnecessary to pursue
the point farther; the reader, having his attention drawn to it,
will observe for himself the many less prominent, but strongly
corroborating circumstances of the narrative, which confirm the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
chronology adopted in it. At all events it must stand until new
and decisive facts against it be found.<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">A Year of Sadness and Gloom</span></div>

<p>“My journey cost me a great deal, and I have not the smallest
hope of earning anything here. Fate is not propitious to me in
Bonn.” In poverty, ill, melancholy, despondent, motherless,
ashamed of and depressed by his father’s ever increasing moral
infirmity, the boy, prematurely old from the circumstances in
which he had been placed since his eleventh year, had yet to bear
another “sling and arrow of outrageous fortune.” The little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
sister, now a year and a half old&mdash;but here is the notice from the
“<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Intelligenzblatt</span>”:&mdash;“Died, November 25, Margareth, daughter
of the Court Musician Johann van Beethoven, aged one year.”
And so faded the last hope that the passionate tenderness of Beethoven’s
nature might find scope in the purest of all relations between
the sexes&mdash;that of brother and sister.</p>

<p>Thus, in sadness and gloom, Beethoven’s seventeenth year
ended.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The von Breuning Family&mdash;Beethoven Brought Under Refining
Influences&mdash;Count Waldstein, His Mæcenas&mdash;The
Young Musician is Forced to Become Head of the
Family.</p></div>


<p>In 1527, the year in which the administration of the office of
<i>Hochmeister</i> of the Teutonic Order was united with that of the
<i>Deutschmeister</i>, whose residence had already been fixed at Mergentheim
in 1525, this city became the principal seat of the order.
From 1732 to 1761 Clemens Augustus was <i>Hoch- und Deutschmeister</i>
of the order; according to the French edition of the Court Calendar
of 1761, Christoph von Breuning was <i>Conseiller d’État et Référendaire</i>,
having succeeded his father-in-law von Mayerhofen in the
office.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Beethoven’s Friends: The von Breunings</span></div>

<p>Christoph von Breuning had five sons: Georg Joseph, Johann
Lorenz, Johann Philipp, Emanuel Joseph and Christoph. Lorenz
became chancellor of the Archdeanery of Bonn, and the <i>Freiadliges
Stift</i> at Neuss; after the death of his brother Emanuel he lived
in Bonn so that, as head of the family, he might care for the education
of the latter’s children. He died there in 1796. Johann
Philipp, born 1742 at Mergentheim, became canon and priest
at Kerpen, a place on the old highway from Cologne to Aix-la-Chapelle,
where he died June 12, 1831. Christoph was court
councillor at Dillingen.</p>

<p>Emanuel Joseph continued in the electoral service at Bonn;
at the early age of 20 years he was already court councillor (<i>Conseiller
actuel</i>). He married Hélène von Kerich, born January 3, 1750,
daughter of Stephan von Kerich, physician to the elector. Her
brother, Abraham von Kerich, canon and scholaster of the
archdeanery of Bonn, died in Coblenz in 1821. A high opinion of
the intellect and character of Madame von Breuning is enforced
upon us by what we learn of her influence upon the youthful
Beethoven. Court Councillor von Breuning perished in a fire
in the electoral palace on January 15, 1777. The young widow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
(she had barely attained her 28th year), continued to live in the
house of her brother, Abraham von Kerich, with her three children,
to whom was added a fourth in the summer of 1777. Immediately
after the death of the father, his brother, the canon Lorenz von
Breuning, changed his residence from Neuss to Bonn and remained
in the same house as guardian and tutor of the orphaned children.
These were:</p>

<p>1. Christoph, born May 13, 1771, a student of jurisprudence
at Bonn, Göttingen and Jena, municipal councillor in Bonn,
notary, president of the city council, professor at the law school
in Coblenz, member of the Court of Review in Cologne, and,
finally, <i>Geheimer Ober-Revisionsrath</i> in Berlin. He died in 1841.</p>

<p>2. Eleonore Brigitte, born April 23, 1772. On March 28, 1802,
she was married to Franz Gerhard Wegeler of Beul-an-der-Ahr,
and died on June 13, 1841, at Coblenz.</p>

<p>3. Stephan, born August 17, 1774. He studied law at Bonn
and Göttingen, and shortly before the end of the electorship of
Max Franz was appointed to an office in the Teutonic Order at
Mergentheim. In the spring of 1801 he went to Vienna, where
he renewed his acquaintance with Beethoven. They had simultaneously
been pupils of Ries in violin playing. The Teutonic
Order offering no chance of advancement to a young man, he
was given employment with the War Council and became Court
Councillor in 1818. He died on June 4, 1827. His first wife
was Julie von Vering, daughter of Ritter von Vering, a military
physician; she died in the eleventh month of her wedded life.
He then married Constanze Ruschowitz, who became the mother
of Dr. Gerhard von Breuning, born August 28, 1813, author of
“<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Aus dem Schwarzspanierhause</span>.”</p>

<p>4. Lorenz (called Lenz, the posthumous child), born in the
summer of 1777, studied medicine and was in Vienna in 1794-97
simultaneously with Wegeler and Beethoven. He died on April
10, 1798 in Bonn.<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>
<p>Madame von Breuning, who died on December 9, 1838, after
a widowhood of 61 years, lived in Bonn until 1815, then in Kerpen,
Beul-an-der-Ahr, Cologne and finally with her son-in-law, Wegeler,
in Coblenz.</p>

<p>The acquaintance between Beethoven and Stephan von
Breuning may have had some influence in the selection of the
young musician as pianoforte teacher for Eleonore and Lorenz,<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a>
an event (in consideration of circumstances already detailed and
of the ages, real and reputed, of pupils and master) which may be
dated at the close of the year 1787, and which was, perhaps, the
greatest good that fate, now become propitious, could have conferred
upon him; for he was now so situated in his domestic relations,
and at such an age, that introduction into so highly refined
and cultivated a circle was of the highest value to him both
morally and intellectually. The recent loss of his mother had
left a void in his heart which so excellent a woman as Madame
von Breuning could alone in some measure fill. He was at an
age when the evil example of his father needed a counterbalance;
when the extraordinary honors so recently paid to science and
letters at the inauguration of the university would make the
strongest impression; when the sense of his deficiencies in everything
but his art would begin to be oppressive; when his mental
powers, so strong and healthy, would demand some change, some
recreation, from that constant strain in the one direction of music
to which almost from infancy they had been subjected; when not
only the reaction upon his mind of the fresh and new intellectual
life now pervading Bonn society, but his daily contact with so
many of his own age, friends and companions now enjoying advantages
for improvement denied to him, must have cost him many a
pang; when a lofty and noble ambition might be aroused to lead
him ever onward and upward; when, the victim of a despondent
melancholy, he might sink into the mere routine musician, with
no lofty aims, no higher object than to draw from his talents
means to supply his necessities and gratify his appetites.</p>

<p>There must have been something very engaging in the character
of the small, pockmarked youth, or he could not have so
won his way into the affections of the Widow von Breuning and
her children. In his “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Notizen</span>” Wegeler writes:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In this house reigned an unconstrained tone of culture in spite of
youthful wilfulness. Christoph von Breuning made early essays in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
poetry, as was the case (and not without success) with Stephan von
Breuning much later. The friends of the family were distinguished by
indulgence in social entertainments which combined the useful and the
agreeable. When we add that the family possessed considerable wealth,
especially before the war, it will be easy to understand that the first
joyous emotions of Beethoven found vent here. Soon he was treated
as one of the children of the family, spending in the house not only the
greater part of his days, but also many nights. Here he felt that he
was free, here he moved about without constraint, everything conspired
to make him cheerful and develop his mind. Being five years older
than Beethoven I was able to observe and form a judgment on these
things.</p></div>

<p>It must not be forgotten that besides Madame von Breuning
and her children the scholastic Abraham von Kerich and the
canon Lorenz von Breuning were members of the household.
The latter especially seems to have been a fine specimen of the
enlightened clergy of Bonn who, according to Risbeck, formed
so striking a contrast to the priests and monks of Cologne; and
it is easy to trace Beethoven’s life-long love for the ancient classics&mdash;Homer
and Plutarch at the head&mdash;to the time when the young
Breunings would be occupied with them in the original under
the guidance of their accomplished tutor and guardian. The
uncle, Philipp von Breuning, may also have been influential in
the intellectual progress of the young musician, for to him at Kerpen
“the family von Breuning and their friends went annually for a
vacation of five or six weeks. There, too, Beethoven several
times spent a few weeks right merrily, and was frequently urged
to play the organ,” as Wegeler tells us in the “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Notizen</span>.” There
let him be left enjoying and profiting by his intimacy with that
family, and returning their kindness in some measure by instructing
Eleonore and Lenz in music, while a new friend and benefactor
is introduced.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Count Waldstein’s Arrival in Bonn</span></div>

<p>Emanuel Philipp, Count Waldstein and Wartemberg von
Dux, and his wife, a daughter of Emanuel Prince Lichtenstein,
were parents of eleven children. The fourth son was Ferdinand
Ernst Gabriel, born March 24, 1762. Uniting in his veins the
blood of many of the houses of the Austrian Empire, there was no
career, no line of preferment open to younger sons of titled families,
which was not open to him, or to which he might not aspire. It
was determined that he should seek activity in the Teutonic Order,
of which Max Franz was Grand Master. According to the rules
and regulations of the order, the young nobleman came to Bonn
to pass his examinations and spend his year of novitiate. Could
the time of his arrival there be determined with certainty, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
date would have a most important bearing either to confirm or
disprove the chronological argument of some of our earlier pages;
but one may well despair of finding so unimportant an event as
the journey of a young man of 25 from Vienna to the Rhine anywhere
upon record. One thing bearing directly upon this point
may be read in the “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Wiener Zeitung</span>” of July 2, 1788. A correspondent
in Bonn says that on “the day before yesterday,” i.e.,
June 17, 1788, “our gracious sovereign, as Hoch- und Deutschmeister,
gave the accolade with the customary ceremonies to
the Count von Waldstein, who had been accepted in the Teutonic
Order.” Allowing for the regular year of novitiate, the Count
was certainly in Bonn before the 17th of June, 1787.</p>

<p>The misfortune of two unlucky Bohemian peasants, strange
as it may seem, gives us, after the lapse of a century, a satisfactory
solution of the difficulty. Some one reports in the “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Wiener
Zeitung</span>” of May, 19, 1787, that on the 4th of that month two
peasant houses were destroyed by fire in the village of Likwitz
belonging to Osegg, and adds: “Count Ferdinand von Waldstein,
moved by a noble spirit of humanity, hurried from Dux, took
charge of affairs and was to be found wherever the danger was
greatest.” It was between May 4 and June 17, 1787, that Waldstein
parted from his widowed mother and journeyed to the place
of his novitiate. His name may easily have become known to
Wegeler before the latter’s departure from Bonn for Vienna.<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a>
Here follows what the good doctor says of the Count&mdash;to what
degree correct or mistaken, the reader can determine for himself:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The first, and in every respect the most important, of the Mæcenases
of Beethoven was Count Waldstein, Knight of the Teutonic Order, and
(what is of greater moment here) the favorite and constant companion
of the young Elector, afterwards Commander of the Order at Virnsberg
and Chancellor of the Emperor of Austria. He was not only a connoisseur
but also a practitioner of music. He it was who gave all manner
of support to our Beethoven, whose gifts he was the first to recognize
worthily. Through him the young genius developed the talent to improvise
variations on a given theme. From him he received much
pecuniary assistance bestowed in such a way as to spare his sensibilities,
it being generally looked upon as a small gratuity from the Elector.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
<p>Beethoven’s appointment as organist, his being sent to Vienna by the
Elector, were the doings of the Count. When Beethoven at a later date
dedicated the great and important Sonata in C major, Op.&nbsp;53, to him,
it was only a proof of the gratitude which lived on in the mature man.
It is to Count Waldstein that Beethoven owed the circumstance that
the first sproutings of his genius were not nipped; therefore we owe this
Mæcenas Beethoven’s later fame.</p></div>

<p>Frau Karth remembered distinctly the 17th of June upon
which Waldstein entered the order, the fact being impressed
upon her mind by a not very gentle reminder from the stock of
a sentinel’s musket that the palace chapel was no place for children
on such an occasion. She remembered Waldstein’s visits to
Beethoven in the years following in his room in the Wenzelgasse
and was confident that he made the young musician a present of
a pianoforte.</p>

<p>To save his line from extinction the Count obtained a dispensation
from his vows and married (May 9, 1812) Maria Isabella,
daughter of Count Rzewski. A daughter, Ludmilla, was born
to him; but no son. He died on August 29, 1823, and the family of
Waldsteins of Dux disappears. While all that Wegeler says of
this man’s kindness in obtaining the place of organist for Beethoven
and of his influence upon his musical education is one grand mistake,<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a>
there is no reason whatever to doubt that those qualities
which made the youth a favorite with the Breunings, added to
his manifest genius, made their way to the young count’s heart
and gained for Beethoven a zealous, influential and active friend.
Still, in June, 1778, Waldstein possessed no such influence as to
render a petition for increase of salary, offered by his protégé,
successful. That document has disappeared, but a paper remains,
dated June 5, concerning the petition, which is endorsed “Beruhet.”
Whatever this word may here mean it is certain that Ludwig’s
salary as organist remained at the old point of 100 thalers,
which, with the 200 received by his father, the three measures
of grain and the small sum that he might earn by teaching, was all
that Johann van Beethoven and three sons, now respectively in
their eighteenth, fifteenth and twelfth years, had to live upon;
and therefore so much the more necessity for the exercise of
Waldstein’s generosity.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Ludwig the Head of the Family</span></div>

<p>After the death of the mother, says Frau Karth, a housekeeper
was employed and the father and sons remained together
in the lodgings in the Wenzelgasse. Carl was intended for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
musical profession; Johann was put apprentice to the court apothecary,
Johann Peter Hittorf. Two years, however, had hardly
elapsed when the father’s infirmity compelled the eldest son,
not yet nineteen years of age, to take the extraordinary step of
placing himself at the head of the family. One of Stephan von
Breuning’s reminiscences shows how low Johann van Beethoven
had sunk: viz., that of having seen Ludwig furiously interposing
to rescue his intoxicated father from an officer of police.</p>

<p>Here again the petition has disappeared, but its contents
are sufficiently made known by the terms of the decree dated
November 20, 1789:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>His Electoral Highness having graciously granted the prayer of
the petitioner and dispensed henceforth wholly with the services of his
father, who is to withdraw to a village in the electorate, it is graciously
commanded that he be paid in accordance with his wish only 100 rthr.
of the annual salary which he has had heretofore, beginning with the
approaching new year, and that the other 100 thlr. be paid to the suppliant’s
son besides the salary which he now draws and the three measures
of grain for the support of his brothers.</p></div>

<p>It is probable that there was no intention to enforce this
decree in respect of the withdrawal of the father from Bonn, and
that this clause was inserted <i>in terrorem</i> in case he misbehaved
himself; for he continued, according to Frau Karth, to dwell
with his children, and his first receipt, still preserved, for the
reduced salary is dated at Bonn&mdash;a circumstance, however, which
alone would prove little or nothing.</p>

<h2>Chapter VIII</h2>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The National Theatre of Max Franz&mdash;Beethoven’s Artistic
Associates&mdash;Practical Experience in the Orchestra&mdash;The
“<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Ritterballet</span>”&mdash;The Operatic Repertory of Five Years.</p></div>


<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Opera under Elector Max Franz</span></div>

<p>Early in the year 1788, the mind of the Elector, Max Franz,
was occupied with the project for forming a company of
<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Hofschauspieler;</i> in short, with the founding of a National
Theatre upon the plan adopted by his predecessor in Bonn and by
his brother Joseph in Vienna. His finances were now in order, the
administration of public affairs in able hands and working smoothly,
and there was nothing to hinder him from placing both music and
theatre upon a better and permanent footing; which he now proceeded
to do. The Klos troupe, which had left Cologne in March,
played for a space in Bonn, and on its dispersal in the summer
several of its better actors were engaged and added to others who
had already settled in Bonn. The only names which it is necessary
to mention here are those of significance in the history of
Beethoven. Joseph Reicha was director; Neefe, pianist and stage-manager
for opera; in the orchestra were Franz Ries and Andreas
Romberg (violin), Ludwig van Beethoven (viola), Bernard
Romberg (violoncello), Nicolaus Simrock (horn) and Anton
Reicha (flute). A comparison of the lists of the theatrical establishment
with that of the court chapel as printed in the Court
Calendars for 1778 and the following years, shows that the two
institutions were kept distinct, though the names for the greater
part appear in both. Some of the singers in the chapel played
in the theatrical orchestra, while certain of the players in the
chapel sang upon the stage. Other names appear in but one of
the lists.</p>

<p>As organist the name of Beethoven appears still in the Court
Calendar, but as viola player he had a place in both the orchestras.
Thus, for a period of full four years, he had the opportunity of
studying practically orchestral compositions in the best of all
schools&mdash;the orchestra itself. This body of thirty-one members,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
under the energetic leadership of Reicha, many of them young
and ambitious, some already known as virtuosos and still keeping
their places in musical history as such, was a school for instrumental
music such as Handel, Bach, Mozart and Haydn had not
enjoyed in their youth; that its advantages were improved both
by Beethoven and others of the younger men, all the world knows.</p>

<p>One fact worthy of note in relation to this company is the
youth of most of the new members engaged. Maximilian seems
to have sought out young talent, and when it proved to be of
true metal, gave it a permanent place in his service, adopted wise
measures for its cultivation, and thus laid a foundation upon
which, but for the outbreak of the French Revolution, and the
consequent dispersion of his court, would in time have risen a
musical establishment, one of the very first in Germany.</p>

<p>This is equally true of the new members of his orchestra.
Reicha himself was still rather a young man, born in 1757. He
was a virtuoso on the violoncello and a composer of some note;
but his usefulness was sadly impaired by his sufferings from gout.
The cousins Andreas and Bernhard Romberg, Maximilian had
found at Münster and brought to Bonn. They had in their boyhood,
as virtuosos upon their instruments&mdash;Andreas violin,
Bernhard ’cello&mdash;made a tour as far as Paris, and their concerts
were crowned with success. Andreas was born near Münster in
1767, and Ledebur (“<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Tonkünstler Berlins</span>”) adopts the same year
as the date also of Bernhard’s birth. They were, therefore, three
years older than Beethoven and now just past 21. Both were
already industrious and well-known composers and must have
been a valuable addition to the circle of young men in which
Beethoven moved. The decree appointing them respectively
Court Violinist and Court Violoncellist is dated November 19, 1790.</p>

<p>Anton Reicha, a fatherless nephew of the concertmaster,
born at Prague, February 27, 1770, was brought by his uncle to
Bonn. He had been already for some years in that uncle’s care
and under his instruction had become a good player of the flute,
violin and pianoforte. In Bonn, Reicha became acquainted with
Beethoven, who was then organist at court. “We spent fourteen
years together,” says Reicha, “united in a bond like that of Orestes
and Pylades, and were continually side by side in our youth.
After a separation of eight years we saw each other again in Vienna,
and exchanged confidences concerning our experiences.” At the
age of 17 composing orchestral and vocal music for the Electoral
Chapel, a year later flautist in the theatre, at nineteen both flautist
and violinist in the chapel and so intimate a friend of Beethoven,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
who was less than a year his junior&mdash;were Reicha’s laurels no
spur to the ambition of the other?</p>

<p>The names of several of the performers upon wind-instruments
were new names in Bonn, and the thought suggests itself that the
Elector brought with him from Vienna some members of the
<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Harmoniemusik</i> which had won high praise from Reichardt, and
it will hereafter appear that such a band formed part of the musical
establishment in Bonn&mdash;a fact of importance in its bearing upon
the questions of the origin and date of various known works
both of Beethoven and of Reicha, and of no less weight in
deciding where and how these men obtained their marvellous
knowledge of the powers and effects of this class of instruments.</p>

<p>The arrangements were all made in 1788, but not early
enough to admit of the opening of the theatre until after the
Christmas holidays, namely, on the evening of January 3, 1789.
The theatre had been altered and improved. An incendiary fire
threatened its destruction the day before, but did not postpone the
opening. The opening piece was “Der Baum der Diana” by Vincenzo
Martin. It may be thought not very complimentary to
the taste of Maximilian that the first season of his National Theatre
was opened thus, instead of with one of Gluck’s or Mozart’s
masterpieces. It suffices to say that he, in his capacity of Grand
Master of the Teutonic Order, had spent a good part of the
autumn at Mergentheim and only reached Bonn on his return on
the last day of January. Hence he was not responsible for that
selection.</p>

<p>The season which opened on January 3, 1789, closed on
May 23. Within this period the following operas were performed,
Beethoven taking part in the performances as a member of the
orchestra: “Der Baum der Diana” (<i>L’Arbore di Diana</i>), Martin;
“Romeo und Julie,” Georg Benda; “Ariadne” (duo-drama by
Georg Benda); “Das Mädchen von Frascati” (<i>La Frascatana</i>),
Paisiello; “Julie,” Desaides; “Die drei Pächter” (<i>Les trois Fermiers</i>),
Desaides; “Die Entführung aus dem Serail,” Mozart; “Nina,”
Dalayrac; “Trofonio’s Zauberhöhle” (<i>La grotta di Trofonio</i>),
Salieri; “Der eifersüchtige Liebhaber” (<i>L’Amant jaloux</i>), Grétry;
“Der Schmaus” (<i>Il Convivo</i>), Cimarosa; “Der Alchymist,”
Schuster; “Das Blendwerk” (<i>La fausse Magie</i>), Grétry.</p>

<p>The second season began October 13, 1789, and continued
until February 23, 1790. On the 24th of February news reached
Bonn of the death of Maximilian’s brother, the Emperor Joseph II,
and the theatre was closed. The repertory for the season comprised
“Don Giovanni,” Mozart (which was given three times);<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
“Die Colonie” (<i>L’Isola d’Amore</i>), Sacchini; “Der Barbier von
Sevilla” (<i>Il Barbiere di Siviglia</i>), Paisiello; “Romeo und Julie,”
Georg Benda; “Die Hochzeit des Figaro” (<i>Le Nozze di Figaro</i>),
Mozart (given four times); “Nina,” Dalayrac; “Die schöne
Schusterin,” Umlauf; “Ariadne,” Georg Benda; “Die Pilgrimme
von Mecca,” Gluck; “Der König von Venedig” (<i>Il Re Teodoro</i>),
Paisiello; “Der Alchymist,” Schuster; “Das listige Bauernmädchen”
(<i>La finta Giardiniera</i>), Paisiello; “Der Doktor und Apotheker,”
Dittersdorf. A letter to the “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Berliner Annalen des Theaters</span>”
mentions three operas which are not in the list of the theatrical
calendar and indicates that the theatre was opened soon after
receipt of the intelligence of the death of Joseph, and several
pieces performed, among them <i>Il Marchese Tulipano</i> by Paisiello.
The writer also mentions performances of Anfossi’s (or Sarti’s)
<i>Avaro inamorato</i>, Pergolese’s <i>Serva padrona</i> and <i>La Villanella di
spirito</i>, composer unmentioned, by an Italian company headed
by Madame Bianchi.</p>

<p>The third season began October 23, 1790, and closed on
March 8, 1791. Between the opening and November 27, performances
of the following musical-dramatic works are recorded:
“König Theodor in Venedig” (<i>Il Re Teodoro</i>), Paisiello; “Die
Wilden” (<i>Azemia</i>), Dalayrac; “Der Alchymist,” Schuster; “Kein
Dienst bleibt unbelohnt,” (?); “Der Barbier von Sevilla,”
Paisiello; “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Die schöne Schusterin</span>,” Umlauf; “Lilla,” Martini;
“Die Geitzigen in der Falle,” Schuster; “Nina,” Dalayrac; “Dr.
Murner,” Schuster. On March 8, the season closed with a ballet
by Horschelt, “Pyramus und Thisbe.” The reporter in the
“<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Theaterkalender</span>” says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>On Quinquagesima Sunday (March 6) the local nobility performed
in the Ridotto Room a characteristic ballet in old German costume.
The author, His Excellency Count Waldstein, to whom the composition
and music do honor, had shown in it consideration for the chief proclivities
of our ancestors for war, the chase, love and drinking. On March 8, all
the nobility attended the theatre in their old German dress and the parade
made a great, splendid and respectable picture. It was also noticeable
that the ladies would lose none of their charms, were they to return to
the costumes of antiquity.</p></div>

<p>Before proceeding with this history a correction must be
made in this report: the music to the “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Ritterballet</span>,” which was
the characteristic ballet referred to, was not composed by Count
Waldstein but by Ludwig van Beethoven. We shall recur to it
presently. Owing to a long-continued absence of the Elector,
the principal singers and the greater part of the orchestra, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
fourth season did not begin till the 28th of December, 1791.
Between that date and February 20, 1792, the following musical
works were performed: “Doktor und Apotheker,” Dittersdorf;
“Robert und Caliste,” Guglielmi; “Félix,” Monsigny; “Die Dorfdeputirten,”
Schubauer; “Im Trüben ist gut Fischen” (<i>Fra due
Litiganti, il Terzo gode</i>), Sarti; “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Das rothe Käppchen</span>,” Dittersdorf;
“Lilla,” Martini; “Der Barbier von Sevilla,” Paisiello; “Ende
gut, Alles gut,” music by the Electoral Captain d’Antoin; “Die
Entführung aus dem Serail,” Mozart; “Die beiden Savoyarden”
(<i>Les deux petits Savoyards</i>), Dalayrac.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Operas at Bonn in 1792</span></div>

<p>The fifth season began in October, 1792. Of the nine operas
given before the departure of Maximilian and the company to
Münster in December, “Die Müllerin” by De la Borde, “König
Axur in Ormus” by Salieri, and “Hieronymus Knicker” by Dittersdorf,
were the only ones new to Bonn; and in only the first two
of these could Beethoven have taken part, unless at rehearsals;
for at the beginning of November he left Bonn&mdash;and, as it proved,
forever. Probably Salieri’s masterpiece was his last opera within
the familiar walls of the Court Theatre of the Elector of Cologne.</p>

<p>Beethoven’s eighteenth birthday came around during the
rehearsals for the first season, of this theatre; his twenty-second
just after the beginning of the fifth. During four years (1788-1792)
he was adding to his musical knowledge and experience in a
direction wherein he has usually been represented as deficient&mdash;as
active member of an operatic orchestra; and the catalogue of
works performed shows that the best schools of the day, save
that of Berlin, must have been thoroughly mastered by him in all
their strength and weakness. Beethoven’s titanic power and
grandeur would have marked his compositions under any circumstances;
but it is very doubtful if, without the training of those
years in the Electoral “Toxal, Kammer und Theater” as member
of the orchestra, his works would have so abounded in melodies
of such profound depths of expression, of such heavenly serenity
and repose and of such divine beauty as they do, and which give
him rank with the two greatest of melodists, Handel and Mozart.</p>

<p>As a pendant to the preceding sketches of Bonn’s musical
history a variety of notices belonging to the last three years
of Beethoven’s life in his native place are here brought together
in chronological order. Most of them relate to him personally,
and some of them, through errors of date, have been looked
upon hitherto as adding proofs of the precocity of his genius.</p>

<p>Prof. Dr. Wurzer communicated to the “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Kölnische Zeitung</span>”
of August 30, 1838, the following pleasant anecdote:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In the summer of the year 1790 or 1791 I was one day on business
in Godesberger Brunnen. After dinner Beethoven and another young
man came up. I related to him that the church at Marienforst (a cloister
in the woods behind Godesberg) had been repaired and renovated, and
that this was also true of the organ, which was either wholly new or at
least greatly improved. The company begged him to give them the
pleasure of letting them hear him play on the instrument. His great
good nature led him to grant our wish. The church was locked, but
the prior was very obliging and had it unlocked for us. B. now began
to play variations on themes given him by the party in a manner that
moved us profoundly; but what was much more significant, poor laboring
folk who were cleaning out the débris left by the work of repair, were so
greatly affected by the music that they put down their implements and
listened with obvious pleasure. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sit ei terra levis!</i></p></div>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Joseph Haydn’s Visit to Bonn</span></div>

<p>The greatest musical event of the year (1790) in Bonn
occurred just at its close&mdash;the visit of Joseph Haydn, on his way
to London with Johann Peter Salomon, whose name so often
occurs in the preliminary chapters of this work. Of this visit,
Dies has recorded Haydn’s own account:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In the capital, Bonn, he was surprised in more ways than one. He
reached the city on Saturday [Christmas, December 25] and set apart<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
the next day for rest. On Sunday, Salomon accompanied Haydn to the
court chapel to listen to mass. Scarcely had the two entered the church
and found suitable seats when high mass began. The first chords
announced a product of Haydn’s muse. Our Haydn looked upon it as an
accidental occurrence which had happened only to flatter him; nevertheless
it was decidedly agreeable to him to listen to his own composition.
Toward the close of the mass a person approached and asked him to
repair to the oratory, where he was expected. Haydn obeyed and was
not a little surprised when he found that the Elector, Maximilian, had
had him summoned, took him at once by the hand and presented him to
the virtuosi with the words: “Here I make you acquainted with the Haydn
whom you all revere so highly.” The Elector gave both parties time
to become acquainted with each other, and, to give Haydn a convincing
proof of his respect, invited him to dinner. This unexpected invitation
put Haydn into an embarrassing position, for he and Salomon had ordered
a modest little dinner in their lodgings, and it was too late to make a
change. Haydn was therefore fain to take refuge in excuses which the
Elector accepted as genuine and sufficient. Haydn took his leave and
returned to his lodgings, where he was made aware in a special manner
of the good will of the Elector, at whose secret command the little dinner
had been metamorphosed into a banquet for twelve persons to which
the most capable musicians had been invited.</p></div>

<p>Was the young musician one of these “most capable musicians”?
Sunday evening, March 6th, came the performance of
Beethoven’s music to the “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Ritterballet</span>” before noticed; but
without his name being known. Bossler’s “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Musikalische Correspondenz</span>”
of July 13, 1791, contains a list of the “Cabinet,
Chapel and Court Musicians of the Elector of Cologne.” Names
designated by an asterisk were “solo players who may justly
be ranked with virtuosi”; two asterisks indicated composers.
Four names only&mdash;those of Joseph Reicha, Perner and the two
Rombergs&mdash;have the two stars; Beethoven has none. “Hr.
Ludwig van Beethoven plays pianoforte concertos; Hr. Neefe
plays accompaniments at court and in the theatre and at concerts....
Concertante violas are played by virtuoso violinists”&mdash;that is
all, except that we learn that the Elector is losing interest in the
instrument on which Beethoven played in the orchestra: “His
Electoral Highness of Cologne seldom plays the viola nowadays,
but finds amusement at the pianoforte with operas, etc., etc.”</p>

<p>At Mergentheim, the capital of the Teutonic Order, a grand
meeting of commanders and knights took place in the autumn
of 1791, the Grand Master Maximilian Francis presiding, and
the sessions continuing from September 18 to October 20, as appears
from the records at Vienna. The Elector’s stay there seems to
have been protracted to a period of at least three months.
During his visit there of equal length two years before, time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
probably dragged heavily, so this time ample provision was made
for theatrical and musical amusement. Among the visiting
theatrical troupes was one called the “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Häusslersche Gesellschaft</span>,”
which played in summer at Nuremberg, in winter in Münster
and Eichstädt. The entrepreneur was Baron von Bailaux, the
chapelmaster Weber, the elder; and among the personnel were
Herr Weber, the younger, and Madame Weber. From Max
Weber’s biography of his father it appears that these Webers
were the brother and sister-in-law of Carl Maria von Weber,
then a child of some five years. “The troupe,” says the reporter
of the “Theater-Kalender,” “performs the choicest pieces and the
grandest operas.” So the father, Franz Anton von Weber, must
have found himself at length in his own proper element, and still
more so a year later, when he himself became the manager.</p>

<p>This company for a time migrated to Mergentheim and
resumed the title of “Kurfürstliches Hoftheater.” Beethoven
soon came thither also. Did he, when in after years he met Carl
Maria von Weber, remember him as a feeble child at Mergentheim?
Had his intercourse there with Fridolin von Weber,
pupil of Joseph Haydn, any influence upon his determination
soon after to become also that great master’s pupil?</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">An Expedition up the Rhine</span></div>

<p>Simonetti, Maximilian’s favorite and very fine tenor concert-singer,
and some twenty-five members of the electoral orchestra,
with Franz Ries as conductor&mdash;Reicha was too ill&mdash;including
Beethoven, the two Rombergs and the fine octet of wind-instruments,
formed an equally ample provision for the strictly
musical entertainments. Actors, singers, musicians&mdash;Simonetti
and the women-singers excepted&mdash;most of them still young, all
in their best years and at the age for its full enjoyment, made the
journey in two large boats up the Rhine and Main. Before leaving
Bonn the company assembled and elected Lux king of the
expedition, who in distributing the high offices of his court conferred
upon Bernhard Romberg and Ludwig van Beethoven the
dignity of, and placed them in his service as, kitchen-boys&mdash;scullions.
It was the pleasantest season of the year for such a
journey, the summer heats being tempered by the coolness of the
Rhine and the currents of air passing up and down the deep gorge
of the river. Vegetation was at its best and brightest, and the
romantic beauty of its old towns and villages had not yet suffered
either by the desolations of the wars soon to break upon them
or by the resistless and romance-destroying march of “modern
improvement.” Coblenz and Mayence were still capitals of states,
and the huge fortress Rheinfels was not yet a ruin. When Risbeck<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
passed down the Rhine ten years before, his boat “had a mast
and sail, a flat deck with a railing, comfortable cabins with windows
and some furniture, and in a general way in style was built
like a Dutch yacht.” In boats like this, no doubt, the jolly
company made the slow and, under the circumstances, perhaps,
tedious journey against the current of the “arrowy Rhine.” But
a glorious time and a merry they had of it. Want of speed was
no misfortune to them, and in Beethoven’s memory the little
voyage lived bright and beautiful and was to him “a fruitful
source of loveliest visions.”</p>

<p>The Bingerloch was then held to be a dangerous, as it certainly
was a difficult pass for boats ascending; for here the river,
suddenly contracted to half its previous width, plunged amid
long lines of rugged rocks into the gorge. So, leaving the boats
to their conductors, the party ascended to the Niederwald; and
there King Lux raised Beethoven to a higher dignity in his court&mdash;Wegeler
does not state what it was&mdash;and confirmed his appointment
by a diploma, or letters patent, dated on the heights above
Rüdesheim. To this important document was attached by thread
ravelled from a sail, a huge seal of pitch, pressed into the cover
of a small box, which gave to the instrument a right imposing
look&mdash;like the Golden Bull at Frankfort. This diploma from the
hand of his comic majesty was among the articles taken by the
possessor to Vienna where Wegeler saw it, still carefully preserved,
in 1796.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Beethoven’s Meeting With Sterkel</span></div>

<p>At Aschaffenburg on the Main was the large summer palace
of the Electors of Mainz; and here dwelt Abbé Sterkel, now a
man of 40 years; a musician from his infancy, one of the first
pianists of all Germany and without a rival in this part of it,
except perhaps Vogler of Mannheim. His style both as composer
and pianist had been refined and cultivated to the utmost, both
in Germany and Italy, and his playing was in the highest degree
light, graceful, pleasing&mdash;as Ries described it to Wegeler, “somewhat
ladylike.” Ries and Simrock took the young Romberg
and Beethoven to pay their respects to the master, “who, complying
with the general request, sat himself down to play. Beethoven,
who up to this time,” says Wegeler, “had not heard a
great or celebrated pianoforte player, knew nothing of the finer
nuances in the handling of the instrument; his playing was rude
and hard. Now he stood with attention all on a strain by the
side of Sterkel”; for this grace and delicacy, if not power of execution,
which he now heard were a new revelation to him. After
Sterkel had finished, the young Bonn concertplayer was invited<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
to take his place at the instrument; but he naturally hesitated
to exhibit himself after such a display. The shrewd Abbé, however,
brought him to it by a pretence of doubting his ability.</p>

<p>A year or two before, Chapelmaster Vincenzo Righini, a colleague
of Sterkel in the service of the Elector of Mayence, had
published “Dodeci Ariette,” one of which, “<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Vieni (Venni) Amore</span>,”
was a melody with five vocal variations, to the same accompaniment.
Beethoven, taking this melody as his theme, had composed,
dedicated to the Countess of Hatzfeld and published twenty-four
variations for the pianoforte upon it. Some of these were very
difficult, and Sterkel now expressed his doubts if their author
could himself play them. His honor thus touched, “Beethoven
played not only these variations so far as he could remember
them (Sterkel could not find them), but went on with a number of
others no less difficult, all to the great surprise of the listeners,
perfectly, and in the ingratiating manner that had struck him in
Sterkel’s playing.”<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a></p>

<p>Once in Mergentheim the merry monarch and his jolly subjects
had other things to think of and seem to have made a noise
in the world in more senses than one. At all events Carl Ludwig
Junker, Chaplain at Kirchberg, the residence of Prince Hohenlohe,
heard of them and then went over to hear them. Junker was a
dilettante composer and the author of some half-dozen small works
upon music&mdash;musical almanacs published anonymously, and the
like, all now forgotten save by collectors, as are his pianoforte
concertos&mdash;but at that time he was a man of no small mark in
the musical world of Western Germany. He came over to Mergentheim,
was treated with great attention by the Elector’s musicians,
and showed his gratitude in a long letter to Bossler’s “Correspondenz”
(November 23, 1791), in which superlatives somewhat
abound, but which is an exquisite piece of gossip and gives
the liveliest picture that exists of the “Kapelle.” We have room
for only a portion of it:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Here I was also an eye-witness to the esteem and respect in which
this chapel stands with the Elector. Just as the rehearsal was to begin
Ries was sent for by the Prince, and upon his return brought a bag of
gold. “Gentlemen,” said he, “this being the Elector’s name-day he
sends you a present of a thousand thalers.” And again, I was eye-witness
of this orchestra’s surpassing excellence. Herr Winneberger, Kapellmeister
at Wallenstein, laid before it a symphony of his own composition,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
which was by no means easy of execution, especially for the wind-instruments,
which had several solos <i>concertante</i>. It went finely, however, at
the first trial, to the great surprise of the composer. An hour after the
dinner-music the concert began. It was opened with a symphony of
Mozart; then followed a recitative and air sung by Simonetti; next, a
violoncello concerto played by Herr Romberger [Bernhard Romberg];
fourthly, a symphony by Pleyel; fifthly, an air by Righini, sung by
Simonetti; sixthly, a double concerto for violin and violoncello played
by the two Rombergs; and the closing piece was the symphony of
Winneberger, which had very many brilliant passages. The opinion
already expressed as to the performance of this orchestra was confirmed.
It was not possible to attain a higher degree of exactness. Such perfection
in the <i>pianos</i>, <i>fortes</i>, <i>rinforzandos</i>&mdash;such a swelling and gradual
increase of tone and then such an almost imperceptible dying away,
from the most powerful to the lightest accents&mdash;all this was formerly
to be heard only in Mannheim. It would be difficult to find another
orchestra in which the violins and basses are throughout in such excellent
hands.... The members of the chapel, almost without exception,
are in their best years, glowing with health, men of culture and fine personal
appearance. They form truly a fine sight, when one adds the
splendid uniform in which the Elector has clothed them&mdash;red, and
richly trimmed with gold.</p>

<p>I heard also one of the greatest of pianists&mdash;the dear, good Bethofen,
some compositions by whom appeared in the Spires “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Blumenlese</span>”
in 1783, written in his eleventh year. True, he did not perform in public,
probably the instrument here was not to his mind. It is one of Spath’s
make, and at Bonn he plays upon one by Steiner. But, what was infinitely
preferable to me, I heard him extemporize in private; yes, I was
even invited to propose a theme for him to vary. The greatness of this
amiable, light-hearted man, as a virtuoso, may in my opinion be safely
estimated from his almost inexhaustible wealth of ideas, the altogether
characteristic style of expression in his playing, and the great execution
which he displays. I know, therefore, no one thing which he lacks,
that conduces to the greatness of an artist. I have heard Vogler upon
the pianoforte&mdash;of his organ playing I say nothing, not having heard
him upon that instrument&mdash;have often heard him, heard him by
the hour together, and never failed to wonder at his astonishing execution;
but Bethofen, in addition to the execution, has greater clearness
and weight of idea, and more expression&mdash;in short, he is more for the
heart&mdash;equally great, therefore, as an <i>adagio</i> or <i>allegro</i> player. Even
the members of this remarkable orchestra are, without exception, his
admirers, and all ears when he plays. Yet he is exceedingly modest
and free from all pretension. He, however, acknowledged to me, that,
upon the journeys which the Elector had enabled him to make, he had
seldom found in the playing of the most distinguished virtuosos that
excellence which he supposed he had a right to expect. His style of
treating his instrument is so different from that usually adopted, that
it impresses one with the idea, that by a path of his own discovery he
has attained that height of excellence whereon he now stands.</p>

<p>Had I acceded to the pressing entreaties of my friend Bethofen,
to which Herr Winterberger added his own, and remained another day<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
in Mergentheim, I have no doubt he would have played to me hours;
and the day, thus spent in the society of these two great artists, would
have been transformed into a day of the highest bliss.</p></div>

<p>There is one passage in this exceedingly valuable and interesting
letter which, in the present state of knowledge of Beethoven’s
youth, is utterly inexplicable. It is this: “Yet he is exceedingly
modest and free from all pretension. He, however, acknowledged
to me that upon the journeys which the Elector had enabled
him to make, he had seldom found in the playing of the
most distinguished virtuosos that excellence which he supposed
he had a right to expect.” What were the journeys? Who can
tell?</p>

<p>There is but one more to add to these musical reminiscences
of that period&mdash;another visit of Joseph Haydn, who, having
changed the plan of his route, returned in July <i>via</i> Bonn from
London to Vienna. The electoral orchestra gave him a breakfast
at Godesberg and there Beethoven laid before him a cantata
“which received the particular attention of Haydn, who encouraged
its author to continue study.” It is not improbable that the
arrangements were in part now made under which the young
composer became a few months later the pupil of the veteran.</p>

<p>Many a eulogy has been written upon Max Franz for his
supposed protection of, and favors granted to, the young Beethoven.
It has, however, already been made clear that except
the gracious reprimand at the time when the singer Heller was
made the subject of the boy’s joke, all the facts and anecdotes upon
which those eulogies are based belong to a much later than the
supposed period. The appointment of Beethoven as Chamber
Musician (1789) was no distinguishing mark of favor. Half a
dozen other youths of his age shared it with him. His being made
Court Pianist was a matter of course; for whom had he as a rival?
Had he been in any great degree a favorite of the Elector, what
need had there been of his receiving from Waldstein, as Wegeler
states, “much pecuniary assistance bestowed in such a way as
to spare his sensibilities, it being generally looked upon as a small
gratuity from the Elector?” One general remark may be made
here which has a bearing upon this point, namely: that Beethoven’s
dedications of important works throughout his life were,
as a rule, made to persons from whom he had received, or from
whom he had hopes of receiving, pecuniary benefits. Indeed, in one
notable case where such a dedication produced him nothing, he
never forgot nor forgave the omission. Had he felt that Maximilian
was in any single instance really generous toward him,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
why did he never dedicate any work to him? Why in all the
correspondence, private memoranda and recorded conversations,
which have been examined for this work, has Beethoven never
mentioned him either in terms of gratitude, or in any manner
whatever? All idea that his relations to the Elector were different
from those of Bernhard Romberg, Franz Ries or Anton Reicha,
must be given up. He was organist, pianist, member of the
orchestra; and for these services received his pay like others.
There is no proof of more, no indication of less.</p>

<p>But with Waldstein, the case was otherwise. The young
count, eight years older than Beethoven, coming direct from
Vienna, where his family connections gave him access to the salons
of the very highest rank of the nobility, was thoroughly acquainted
with the noblest and best that the imperial capital could show
in the art of music. Himself more than an ordinary dilettante,
he could judge of the youth’s powers and became his friend. We
have seen that he used occasionally to go to the modest room in
the Wenzelgasse, that he even employed Beethoven to compose
his “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Ritterballet</span>” music, and we shall see, that he foretold the
future eminence of the composer and that the name, Beethoven,
would stand next those of Mozart and Haydn on the roll of fame.
Waldstein’s name, too, is in Beethoven’s roll of fame; it stands
in the list of those to whom important works are dedicated. The
dedication of the twenty-four variations on “<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Venni Amore</span>” to
the Countess Hatzfeld indicates, if it does not prove, that Beethoven’s
deserts were neither unknown nor unacknowledged at
her house.</p>

<p>At that time the favorite places of resort for the professors
of the new university and for young men whose education and
position at court or in society were such as to make them welcome
guests, was the house on the Market-place now known as the
Zehrgarten; and there, says Frau Karth, Beethoven was in the
habit of going. A large portion of this house was let in lodgings,
and it is said that Eugène Beauharnais, with his wife and children,
at one time occupied the first floor. Its mistress was the Widow
Koch who spread also a table for a select company of boarders.
Her name, too, often appears in the “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Intelligenzblatt</span>” of Bonn
in advertisements of books and music. Of her three children,
a son and two daughters, the beautiful Barbara&mdash;the Babette
Koch mentioned in a letter of Beethoven’s&mdash;was the belle of
Bonn. Wegeler’s eulogy of her (“<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Notizen</span>,” p. 58) contains the
names of several members of that circle whom, doubtless, the
young composer so often met at the house.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Barbara Koch; Eleonore von Breuning</span></div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>She was a confidential friend of Eleonore von Breuning, a lady
who of all the representatives of the female sex that I met in a rather
active and long life came nearest the ideal of a perfect woman&mdash;an opinion
which is confirmed by all who had the good fortune to know her well.
She was surrounded not only by young artists like Beethoven, the two
Rombergs, Reicha, the twin brothers Kügelchen and others, but also by
the intellectual men of all classes and ages, such as D. Crevelt, Prof.
Velten, who died early, Fischenich, who afterward became Municipal
Councillor, Prof. Thaddäus Dereser, afterward capitular of the cathedral,
Wrede, who became a bishop, Heckel and Floret, secretaries of the
Elector, Malchus, private secretary of the Austrian minister von Keverberg,
later Government Councillor of Holland, Court Councillor von
Bourscheidt, Christian von Breuning and many others.</p></div>

<p>About the time Beethoven left Bonn for Vienna, the wife of
Count Anton von Belderbusch, nephew of the deceased minister
of that name, had deserted her husband for the embraces of a
certain Baron von Lichtenstein, and Babette Koch was engaged
as governess and instructress of the motherless children. In
process of time Belderbusch obtained a divorce (under the French
law) from his adulterous wife and married the governess, August
9, 1802.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Beethoven in the Breuning House</span></div>

<p>But it was in the Breuning house that Beethoven enjoyed
and profited most. The mother’s kindness towards him gave
her both the right and the power to urge and compel him to the
performance of his duties; and this power over him in his obstinate
and passionate moods she possessed in a higher degree than any
other person. Wegeler gives an anecdote in point: Baron Westphal
von Fürstenberg, until now in the service of the Elector,
was appointed minister to the Dutch and Westphalian Circuit
and to the courts of Cologne and Trèves, his headquarters being
at Bonn. He resided in the large house which is now occupied
by the post-office, directly behind the statue of him who was engaged
as music teacher in the count’s family. The Breuning
house was but a few steps distant diagonally across a corner of
the square. Here Madame von Breuning was sometimes compelled
to use her authority and force the young man to go to his
lessons. Knowing that she was watching him he would go, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ut
iniquæ mentis asellus</i>, but sometimes at the very door would turn
back and excuse himself on the plea that to-day it was impossible
to give a lesson&mdash;to-morrow he would give two; to which, as upon
other occasions when reasoning with him was of no avail, the good
lady would shrug her shoulders with the remark: “He has his
<i>raptus</i> again,” an expression which the rapt Beethoven never
forgot. Most happy was it for him that in Madame von Breuning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
he had a friend who understood his character thoroughly, who
cherished affection for him, who could and did so effectually act
as peace-maker when the harmony between him and her children
was disturbed. Schindler is a witness that just for this phase
of her motherly care Beethoven, down to the close of life, was
duly grateful.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In his later days he still called the members of this family his
guardian angels of that time and remembered with pleasure the many
reprimands which he had received from the lady of the house. “She
understood,” said he, “how to keep insects off the flowers.” By insects
he meant certain friendships which had already begun to threaten danger
to the natural development of his talent and a proper measure of artistic
consciousness by awakening vanity in him by their flatteries. He was
already near to considering himself a famous artist, and therefore more
inclined to give heed to those who encouraged him in his illusions than
such as set before him the fact that he had still to learn everything that
makes a master out of a disciple.</p></div>

<p>This is well said, is very probable in itself, and belongs in
the category of facts as to which Schindler is a trustworthy
witness.</p>

<p>Stephan von Breuning became so good a violinist as to play
occasionally in the electoral orchestra. As he grew older, and
the comparative difference in age between him and Beethoven
lessened, the acquaintance between them became one of great
intimacy. Frau Karth says he was a frequent visitor in the
Wenzelgasse, and she had a lively recollection of “the noise they
used to make with their music” in the room overhead. Lenz,
the youngest of the Breunings, was but fifteen when his teacher
left Bonn, but a few years after he became a pupil of Beethoven
again in Vienna and became a good pianist. For him the composer
seems to have cherished a warm affection, one to which
the seven years’ difference in their ages gave a peculiar tenderness.
It has been supposed that Beethoven at one time indulged
a warmer feeling than mere friendship for Eleonore von Breuning;
but this idea is utterly unsupported by anything which has been
discovered during the inquiries made for this work.</p>

<p>Beethoven’s remarkable powers of improvising were often
exhibited at the Breuning house. Wegeler has an anecdote here:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Once when Beethoven was improvising at the house of the Breunings
(on which occasions he used frequently to be asked to characterize in
the music some well-known person) Father Ries was urged to accompany
him upon the violin. After some hesitation he consented, and this may
have been the first time that two artists improvised a duo.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>

<p>Beethoven had in common with all men of original and
creative genius a strong repugnance to the drudgery of forcing
the elements of his art into dull brains and awkward fingers; but
that this repugnance was “extraordinary,” as Wegeler says, does
not appear. A Frau von Bevervörde, one of his Bonn pupils,
assured Schindler that she never had any complaint to make of
her teacher in respect to either the regularity of his lessons or
his general course of instruction. Nor is there anything now
to be gathered from the traditions at Vienna which justifies the
epithet. Ries’s experience is not here in point, for his relations
to Beethoven were like those of little Hummel to Mozart. He
received such instruction gratis as the master in leisure moments
felt disposed to give. There was no pretence of systematic teaching
at stated hours. The occasional neglect of a lesson at Baron
Westphal’s, as detailed in the anecdote above given, may be explained
on other ground than that of extraordinary repugnance
to teaching. Beethoven was, in 1791-’92, just at the age when
the desire for distinction was fresh and strong; he was conscious of
powers still not fully developed; his path was diverse from that
of the other young men with whom he associated and who, from
all that can be gathered now on the subject, had little faith in
that which he had chosen. He must have felt the necessity of
other instruction, or, at all events, of better opportunities to compare
his powers with those of others, to measure himself by a
higher standard, to try the effect of his compositions in another
sphere, to satisfy himself that his instincts as a composer were
true and that his deviations from the beaten track were not wild
and capricious. Waldstein, we know from Wegeler (and this
is confirmed by his own words), had faith in him and his works,
and it will be seen that another, Fischenich, had also. But
what would be said of him and his compositions in the city of
Mozart, Haydn, Gluck? To this add the restlessness of an ambitious
youth to whom the routine of duties, which must long
since in great measure have lost the charm of novelty, had become
tedious, and the natural longing of young men for the great world,
for a wider field of action, had grown almost insupportable.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Beethoven’s Sweethearts in Bonn</span></div>

<p>Or Beethoven’s <i>raptus</i> may just then have had a very different
origin; Jeannette d’Honrath, or Fräulein Westerhold, was
perhaps the innocent cause&mdash;two young ladies whose names are
preserved by Wegeler of the many for whom he says his friend
at various times indulged transient, but not the less ardent, passions.
The former was from Cologne, whence she occasionally
came to Bonn to pass a few weeks with Eleonore von Breuning.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“She was a beautiful, vivacious blond, of good education,” says
Wegeler, “and amiable disposition, who enjoyed music greatly and possessed
an agreeable voice; wherefore she several times teased our friend
by singing a song, familiar at the time, beginning:</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">‘Mich heute noch von dir zu trennen<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Und dieses nicht verhindern können,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Ist zu empfindlich für mein Herz!’<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>for the favored rival was the Austrian recruiting officer in Cologne,
Carl Greth, who married the young lady and died on October 15, 1827,
as Field Marshal General, Commander of the 23rd Regiment of Infantry
and Commandant at Temesvar.”<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></p></div>

<p>The passion for Miss d’Honrath was eclipsed by a subsequent
fancy for a Fräulein von Westerhold. The Court Calendars of
these years name “Hochfürstlich Münsterischer Obrist-Stallmeister,
Sr. Excellenz der Hochwohlgeborne Herr Friedrich
Rudolph Anton, Freyherr von Westerhold-Giesenberg, kurkölnischer
und Hochstift-Münsterischer Geheimrath.” This much
betitled man, according to Neefe (Spazier’s “Berlin. Mus. Zeitung”),</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>played the bassoon himself and maintained a fair band among his servants,
particularly players of wind-instruments. He had two sons, one
of whom was a master of the flute, and two daughters. The elder
daughter&mdash;the younger was still a child&mdash;Maria Anna Wilhelmine, was
born on July 24, 1774, married Baron Friedrich Clemens von Elverfeldt,
called von Beverföde-Werries, on April 24, 1792, and died on November
3, 1852. She was an excellent pianist. In Münster, Neefe heard “the
fiery Mad. von Elverfeldt play a difficult sonata by Sardi (not Sarti)
with a rapidity and accuracy that were marvellous.”</p></div>

<p>It is not surprising that Beethoven’s talent should have met
with recognition and appreciation in this musical family. He
became the young woman’s teacher, and as the chief equerry
Count Westerhold had to accompany the Elector on his visits to
Münster, where, moreover, he owned a house, there is a tradition
in the family that young Beethoven went with them before the
young lady’s marriage in 1790. She it was with whom Beethoven
was now in love. He had the disease violently, nor did he “let
concealment, like a worm i’ th’ bud,” feed upon his cheek. Forty
years afterward Bernhard Romberg had anecdotes to relate of
this “Werther love.”</p>

<p>The strong doubt that any such feeling for Eleonore von
Breuning was ever cherished by Beethoven has already been
expressed. The letters to her from Vienna printed by Wegeler,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
and other correspondence still in manuscript, confirm this doubt
by their general tone; but that a really warm friendship existed
between them and continued down to the close of his life, with a
single interruption just before he left Bonn, of the cause of
which nothing is known, so much is certain. Among the few
souvenirs of youthful friendship which he preserved was the
following compliment to him on his twentieth birthday, surrounded
by a wreath of flowers:</p>

</div></div>

<p>Another was a silhouette of Fräulein von Breuning. Referring
to Beethoven’s allusion to this in a letter to Wegeler (1825) the
latter says: “In two evenings the silhouettes of all the members
of the von Breuning family and more intimate friends of the house,
were made by the painter Neesen of Bonn. In this way I came
into the possession of that of Beethoven which is here printed.
Beethoven was probably in his sixteenth year at the time”;&mdash;far
more probably in his nineteenth, the reader will say.</p>

<p>To the point of Beethoven’s susceptibility to the tender
passion let Wegeler again be cited:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The truth as I learned to know it, and also my brother-in-law
Stephan von Breuning, Ferdinand Ries, and Bernhard Romberg, is
that there was never a time when Beethoven was not in love, and that
in the highest degree. These passions, for the Misses d’Honrath and
Westerhold, fell in his transition period from youth to manhood, and
left impressions as little deep as were those made upon the beauties who
had caused them. In Vienna, at all events so long as I lived there,
Beethoven was always in love and occasionally made a conquest which
would have been very difficult if not impossible for many an Adonis.</p></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>
<p>A review of some of the last pages shows that for the most
part after 1789 the life of Beethoven was a busy one, but that the
frequent absences of the Elector, as recorded in the newspapers
of the day, left many a period of considerable duration during
which, except for the meetings of the orchestra for rehearsal and
study, he had full command of his time. Thus he had plenty of
leisure hours and weeks to devote to composition, to instruction
in music, for social intercourse, for visits to Kerpen and other
neighboring places, for the indulgence of his strong propensity
to ramble in the fields and among the mountains, for the cultivation
in that beautiful Rhine region of his warm passion for nature.</p>

<p>The new relations to his father and brothers, as virtual head
of the family, were such as to relieve his mind from anxiety on
their account. His position in society, too, had become one of
which he might justly be proud, owing, as it was, to no adventitious
circumstances, but simply to his genius and high personal
character. Of illness in those years we hear nothing, except
Wegeler’s remark (“<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Notizen</span>,” 11): “When the famous organist
Abbé Vogler played in Bonn (1790 or 1791) I sat beside Beethoven’s
sickbed”; a mere passing attack, or Wegeler would have vouchsafed
it a more extended notice in his subsequent remarks upon
his friend’s health. Thus these were evidently happy years, in
spite of certain characteristic and gloomy expressions of Beethoven
in letters hereafter to be given, and years of active intellectual,
artistic and moral development.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">The Suggestion of Haydn as Teacher</span></div>

<p>The probability that in July, 1792, it had been proposed to
Haydn to take Beethoven as a pupil has been mentioned; but
it is pretty certain that the suggestion did not come from the
Elector, who, there is little doubt, was in Frankfort at the coronation
of his nephew Emperor Franz (July 14) at the time of Haydn’s
visit. The indefatigable Karajan<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> is unable to determine precisely
when the composer left London or reached Vienna; but
it is known he was in the former city after July 1st and in the
latter before August 4th. Whatever arrangements may have been
made between the pupil and master, they were subject to the will
of the Elector, and here Waldstein may well have exerted himself
to his protégé’s advantage. At all events, the result was favorable
and the journey determined upon. Perhaps, had Haydn
found Maximilian in Bonn, he might have taken the young man
with him; as it was, some months elapsed before his pupil could
follow.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>
<p>Some little space must be devoted to the question, whence
the pecuniary resources for so expensive a journey to and sojourn
in Vienna were derived. The good-hearted Neefe did not forget
to record the event in very flattering terms when he wrote next
year in Spazier’s “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Berliner Musik-Zeitung</span>”:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In November of last year Ludwig van Beethoven, assistant court
organist and unquestionably now one of the foremost pianoforte players,
went to Vienna <i>at the expense of our Elector</i> to Haydn in order to perfect
himself under his direction more fully in the art of composition.</p></div>

<p>In a note he adds:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Inasmuch as this L. v. B. according to several reports is said to be
making great progress in art and owes a part of his education to Herr
Neefe in Bonn, to whom he has expressed his gratitude in writing, it may
be well (Herr N’s modesty interposing no objection) to append a few
words here, since, moreover, they redound to the credit of Herr B.: “I
thank you for your counsel very often given me in the course of my
progress in my divine art. If ever I become a great man, yours will be
some of the credit. This will give you the greater pleasure, since you
can remain convinced, etc.”</p></div>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">The Limit of Maximilian’s Favor</span></div>

<p>“At the expense of our Elector”&mdash;so says Neefe; so, too,
Fischenich says of Beethoven “whom the Elector has sent to
Haydn in Vienna.” Maximilian, then, had determined to show
favor to the young musician. This idea is confirmed by Beethoven’s
noting, in the small memorandum book previously referred
to, the reception soon after reaching Vienna of 25 ducats
and his disappointment that the sum had not been a hundred.
(A receipt for his salary, 25 th. for the last quarter of this year,
still in the Düsseldorf archives, is dated October 22, and seems at
first sight to prove an advance per favor; but many others in
the same collection show that payments were usually made about
the beginning of the second month of each quarter.) There is
also a paper in the Düsseldorf collection, undated, but clearly only
a year or two after Beethoven’s departure, by which important
changes are made in the salaries of the Elector’s musicians. In
this list Beethoven does not appear among those paid from the
<i>Landrentmeisterei</i> (i.e., the revenues of the state), but is to receive
from the <i>Chatouille</i> (privy purse) 600 florins&mdash;a sum equivalent
to the hundred ducats which he had expected in vain. It is true
these changes were never carried out, but the paper shows the
Elector’s intentions.</p>

<p>With such facts before us, how is Beethoven to be relieved
of the odium of ingratitude to his benefactor? By the circumstance
that, for anything that appears, the good intentions of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
the Elector&mdash;excepting in an increase of salary hereafter to be
noted, and the transmission of the 25 ducats&mdash;were never carried
out; and the young musician, after receiving his quarterly payment
two or three times, was left entirely dependent upon his
own resources. Maximilian’s justification lies in the sea of troubles
by which he was so soon to be overwhelmed.</p>

<p>That the 100 ducats were not advanced to Beethoven before
leaving Bonn is easily accounted for. In October, 1792, the French
revolutionary armies were approaching the Rhine. On the 22nd
they entered Mayence; on the 24th and 25th the archives and
funds of the court at Bonn were packed up and conveyed down
the Rhine. On the 31st the Elector, accompanied by the Prince
of Neuwied, reached Cleve on his first flight from his capital.
It was a time of terror. All the principal towns of the Rhine
region, Trèves, Coblenz, etc., even Cologne, were deserted by the
higher classes of the inhabitants. Perhaps it was owing to this
that Beethoven obtained permission to leave Bonn for Vienna
just then instead of waiting until the approaching theatrical and
musical season had passed. But with the treasury removed to
Düsseldorf, he had to content himself with just sufficient funds
to pay his way to Vienna and the promise of more to be forwarded
thither.</p>

<p>Beethoven’s departure from Bonn called forth lively interest
on the part of his friends. The plan did not contemplate a long
sojourn in the Austrian capital; it was his purpose, after completing
his studies there, to return to Bonn and thence to go forth
on artistic tours.<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> This is proved by an autograph album dating
from his last days in Bonn, which some of his intimate friends,
obviously those with whom he was wont to associate at the Zehrgarten,
sent with him on his way, now preserved in the Imperial
Library at Vienna. The majority of the names are familiar to
us, but many which one might have expected to find, notably
those of the musicians of Bonn, are missing. Eleonore von
Breuning’s contribution was a quotation from Herder:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>

<p>Most interesting of all the inscriptions in the album, however,
is that of Count Waldstein, which was first published by Schindler
(Vol. I, p. 18) from a copy procured for him by Aloys Fuchs. It
proves how great were the writer’s hopes, how strong his faith
in Beethoven:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Dear Beethoven! You are going to Vienna in fulfillment of your
long-frustrated wishes. The Genius of Mozart is mourning and weeping
over the death of her pupil. She found a refuge but no occupation with
the inexhaustible Haydn; through him she wishes to form a union with
another. With the help of assiduous labor you shall receive <i>Mozart’s
spirit from Haydn’s hands</i>.</p>

<p class="sig">
Your true friend<br />
Waldstein.</p>
<p class="date">
Bonn, October 29, 1792.</p></div>

<p>The dates in the album prove that Beethoven was still in
Bonn on November 1, 1792, and indicate that it was the last day
of his sojourn there. In Duten’s “Journal of Travels,” as translated
and augmented by John Highmore, Gent. (London, 1782)&mdash;a
Baedeker’s or Murray’s handbook of that time&mdash;the post-road
from Bonn to Frankfort-on-the-Main is laid down as passing
along the Rhine <i>via</i> Andernach to Coblenz, and thence, crossing
the river at Ehrenbreitstein, <i>via</i> Montabaur, Limburg, Würges
and Königstein;&mdash;corresponding to the route advertised in the
“<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Intelligenzblatt</span>” a few years later&mdash;time 25 hours, 43 minutes.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">The Journey to Vienna</span></div>

<p>This was the route taken by Beethoven and some unknown
companion. Starting from Bonn at 6 a.m. they would, according
to Dutens and Highmore, dine at Coblenz about 3 p.m. and be
in Frankfort about 7 next morning.</p>

<p>The first three pages of the memorandum book above cited
contain a record of the expenses of this journey as far as Würges.
One of the items is this: “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Trinkgeld</span> (<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pourboire</i>) at Coblenz because
the fellow drove like the devil right through the Hessian army at
the risk of a cudgelling, one small thaler.” This army marched
from Coblenz on November 5; but on the same day a French
corps, having advanced from Mayence beyond Limburg, took
possession of Weilburg. The travellers could not, therefore, have
journeyed through Limburg later than the night of the 3rd. We
conclude, then, that it was between November 1st and 3rd that
Beethoven bade farewell to Bonn, and at Ehrenbreitstein saw
Father Rhine for the last time.</p>

<p>The temptation is too strong to be resisted to add here the
contents of the three pages of the memorandum book devoted to
this journey, and the reasonings&mdash;fancies, if the reader prefers
the term&mdash;drawn from them, upon which is founded the assertion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
that Beethoven had a travelling companion. This is probable
in itself, and is confirmed by, first, two handwritings; second,
the price paid for post-horses (thus, the first entry is for a station
and a quarter at 50 <i>Stüber</i>, the regular price being one florin, or
40 <i>Stüber</i> per horse for a single passenger; there were, therefore,
two horses and 10 <i>Stüber</i> extra per post for the second passenger);
third, the word “us” in the record of the <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Trinkgeld</i> at Coblenz;
fourth, the accounts cease at Würges, but they would naturally
have been continued to Vienna had they been noted down by
Beethoven from motives of economy; fifth, the payment of 2 fl.
for dinner and supper is certainly more than a young man, not
overburdened with money, would in those days have spent at
the post-house.</p>

<p>We may suppose, then, that the companions have reached
the end of their journey in common, and sit down to compute and
divide the expenses. Beethoven hands his blank-book to his
friend, who writes thus:</p>


<div class="center">
<table class="tdl" border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="">

<tr><td>Tolls to Coblenz</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>These last three items are not carried out, and Beethoven
now takes the book and adds the items of the “Tolls to Andernach”
thus:</p>


<div class="center">
<table class="tdl" border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="">

<p>These 26 Stüber, changed into Kreutzers, make up the 42 in
the column above. On the next page he continues:</p>


<div class="center">

</table></div>

<p>The other hand now writes:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
The same money for meals and tips, besides 12 x
road money to Wirges.
</div>

<p>The entries of the second and third pages are now changed
into florin currency and brought together, making 22 fl. and 14 x;
add the expenses on the first page to this sum and we have a total
of about 35 fl. from Bonn to Würges for two young men travelling
day and night, and no doubt as economically as was possible.</p>

<p>The next entries are by Beethoven’s hand in Vienna, and we
are left to imagine his arrival in Frankfort and his departure thence
<i>via</i> Nuremberg, Regensburg, Passau and Linz in the public post-coach
for Vienna. Proof will be found hereafter that he was in
that city on or before November 10th, and that Schindler (Vol. I,
p. 19) therefore confounds this journey with that of 1787, and
is all wrong when he says “they travelled very slowly and the
money which they had taken along was exhausted before they
had traversed half the journey.”</p>

<p>But for the outbreak of the French Revolution, Bonn seems
to have been destined to become a brilliant centre of learning
and art. Owing to the Elector’s taste and love for music, that
art became&mdash;what under the influence of Goethe poetry and drama
were in Weimar&mdash;the artistic expression and embodiment of the
intellectual character of the time. In this art, among musicians
and composers, Beethoven, endowed with a genius whose originality
has rarely if ever been surpassed, “lived, moved and had
his being.” His official superiors, Lucchesi, Reicha, Neefe, were
indefatigable in their labors for the church, the stage and the
concert-room; his companions, Andreas Perner, Anton Reicha,
the Rombergs, were prolific in all the forms of composition from
the set of variations to even the opera and oratorios; and in the
performance of their productions, as organist, pianist and viola
player, he, of course, assisted. The trophies of Miltiades allowed
no rest to Themistocles. Did the applause bestowed upon the
scenes, duos, trios, quartets, symphonies, operas of his friends
awaken no spirit of emulation in him? Was he contented to be
the mere performer, leaving composition to others? And yet
what a “beggarly account” is the list of compositions known to
belong to this period of his life!<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> Calling to mind the activity of
others, particularly Mozart, developed in their boyhood, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
reflecting on the incentives which were offered to Beethoven
in Bonn, one may well marvel at the small number and the small
significance of the compositions which preceded the Trios Op.&nbsp;1,
with which, at the age of 24 years, he first presented himself to
the world as a finished artist. But a change has come over the
picture in the progress of time. Not only are the beginnings of
many works which he presented to the world at a late day as the
ripe products of his genius to be traced back to the Bonn period;
fate has also made known to us compositions of his youth which,
for a long time, were lost in whole or in part, and which, in connection
with the three great pianoforte quartets of 1785, not only
disclose a steady progress, but also discover the self-developed
individual artist at a much earlier date than has heretofore been
accepted. Now that we are again in possession of the cantatas
and other fruits of the Bonn period, or have learned to know them
better as such, we are able to free ourselves from the old notion
which presented Beethoven as a slowly and tardily developed
master.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Cantata on the Death of Joseph II</span></div>

<p>The most interesting of Beethoven’s compositions in the Bonn
period are unquestionably the cantatas on the death of Joseph II
and the elevation of Leopold II. Beethoven did not bring them
either to performance or publication; they were dead to the world.
Nottebohm called attention to the fact that manuscript copies
of their scores were announced in the auction catalogue of the
library of Baron de Beine in April, 1813. It seems probable that
Hummel purchased them at that time; at any rate, after his death
they found their way from his estate into the second-hand bookshop
of List and Francke in Leipsic, where they were bought in 1884
by Armin Fridmann of Vienna. Dr. Eduard Hanslick acquainted
the world with the rediscovered treasures in a feuilleton published
in the “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Neue Freie Presse</span>” newspaper of Vienna on May 13, 1884,
and the funeral cantata was performed for the first time at Vienna
in November, 1884, and at Bonn on June 29, 1885.<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> Both cantatas
were then included in the Complete Works of Beethoven published
by Breitkopf and Härtel. The “Cantata on the Death of Joseph
the Second, composed by L. van Beethoven,” was written between
March and June, 1790. The Emperor died on February 20th,
and the news of his death reached Bonn on February 24th. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Lesegesellschaft</span> at once planned a memorial celebration, which
took place on March 19th. At a meeting held to make preparations
for the function on February 28, Prof. Eulogius Schneider
(who delivered the memorial address) expressed the wish that
a musical feature be incorporated in the programme and said that
a young poet had that day placed a poem in his hands which only
needed a setting from one of the excellent musicians who were
members of the society or a composer from elsewhere. Beethoven’s
most influential friends, at the head of them Count Waldstein,
were members of the society. Here, therefore, we have
beyond doubt the story of how Beethoven’s composition originated.
The minutes of the last meeting for preparation, held on March 17,
state that “for various reasons the proposed cantata cannot be
performed.” Among the various reasons may have been the
excessive difficulty of the parts for the wind-instruments which,
according to Wegeler, frustrated a projected performance at Mergentheim;
though it is also possible that Beethoven, who was
notoriously a slow worker, was unable to complete the music in
the short time which was at his disposal. The text of the cantata
was written by Severin Anton Averdonk, son of an employee
of the electoral Bureau of Accounts, and brother of the court
singer Johanna Helene Averdonk, who, in her youth, was for a
space a pupil of Johann van Beethoven. Beethoven set the young
poet’s ode for solo voice, chorus and orchestra without trumpets
and drums. Brahms, on playing through the score, remarked:
“It is Beethoven through and through. Even if there were no
name on the title-page none other than that of Beethoven could
be conjectured.” The same thing may be said of the “Cantata
on the Elevation of Leopold II to the Imperial Dignity, composed
by L. <span class="smcap">v.</span> Beethoven.” Leopold’s election as Roman Emperor
took place on September 30, 1790, his coronation on October 9,
when Elector Max Franz was present at Frankfort. This gives
us a hint as to the date of the composition. Whether or not the
Elector commissioned it cannot be said. Averdonk was again
the poet. The two cantatas mark the culmination of Beethoven’s
creative labors in Bonn; they show his artistic individuality
ripened and a sovereign command of all the elements which Bonn
was able to teach him from a technical point of view.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Other Works of the Bonn Period</span></div>

<p>Two airs for bass voice with orchestral accompaniment are,
to judge by the handwriting, also to be ascribed to about 1790.
The first is entitled “‘<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Prüfung des Küssens</span>’ (’The Test of Kissing’),
<span class="smcap">v.</span> L. <span class="smcap">v.</span> Beethowen.” The use of the “w” instead of the “v” in the
spelling of the name points to an early period for the composition.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
The text of the second bears the title, “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Mit Mädeln sich vertragen</span>,”
and was taken by Beethoven from the original version of Goethe’s
“Claudine von Villa Bella.” Paper, handwriting and the spelling
of the name of the composer indicate the same period as the first
air. The two compositions remained unknown a long time, but
are now to be had in the Supplement to the Complete Works published
by Breitkopf and Härtel.</p>

<p>To these airs must be added a considerable number of songs
as fruits of Beethoven’s creative labors in Bonn. The first of
these, “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Ich, der mit flatterndem Sinn</span>,” was made known by publication
in the Complete Works. A sketch found among sketches
for the variations on “<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Se vuol ballare</span>,” led Nottebohm to set down
1792 as the year of its origin. Of the songs grouped and published
as Op.&nbsp;52 the second, “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Feuerfarbe</span>,” belongs to the period of transition
from Bonn to Vienna. On January 26, 1793, Fischenich
wrote to Charlotte von Schiller: “I am enclosing with this a setting
of the ‘<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Feuerfarbe</span>’ on which I should like to have your opinion.
It is by a young man of this place whose musical talents are universally
praised and whom the Elector has sent to Haydn in Vienna.
He proposes also to compose Schiller’s ‘Freude,’ and indeed strophe
by strophe. Ordinarily he does not trouble himself with such trifles
as the enclosed, which he wrote at the request of a lady.” From
this it is fair to conclude that the song was finished before Beethoven’s
departure from Bonn. Later he wrote a new postlude,
which is found among <i>motivi</i> for the Octet and the Trio in C minor.
Of the other songs in Op.&nbsp;52 the origin of several may be set down
as falling in the Bonn period. That of the first, “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Urian’s Reise
um die Welt</span>,” we have already seen. Whether or not these songs,
which met with severe criticism in comparison with other greater
works of Beethoven, were published without Beethoven’s knowledge,
is doubtful.<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> Probability places the following songs in the
period of transition, or just before it: “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">An Minna</span>,” sketched
on a page with “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Feuerfarbe</span>,” and other works written out in the
early days of the Vienna period; a drinking-song, “to be sung at
parting,” “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Erhebt das Glas mit froher Hand</span>,” to judge by the
handwriting, an early work, presumably <i>circa</i> 1787; “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Elegie auf
den Tod eines Pudels</span>”; “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Die Klage</span>,” to be placed in 1790, inasmuch
as the original manuscript form appears simultaneously<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
with sketches of the funeral cantata; “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Wer ist ein freier Mann?</span>”,
whose original autograph in the British Museum bears the inscription
“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ipse fecit</span> L. v. Beethoven,” and must be placed not later
than 1790, while a revised form is probably a product of 1795, and
to a third Wegeler appended a different text, “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Was ist des Maurer’s
Ziel?</span>” published in 1806; the “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Punschlied</span>” may be a trifle older;
the autograph of “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Man strebt die Flamme zu verhehlen</span>,” in the
possession of the <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Gesellschaft der Musikfreunde</span>, which has been
placed in the year 1792, bears in Beethoven’s handwriting the
words “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pour Madame Weissenthurn par Louis van Beethoven</span>.”
Madame Weissenthurn was a writer and actress, and from 1789
a member of the company of the Burgtheater in Vienna, and it is
more than likely that Beethoven did not get acquainted with her
till he went to Vienna, although she was born on the Rhine.</p>

<p>Turn we now to the instrumental works which date back to
the Bonn period. The beginning is made with the work which,
in a manner, first brought Beethoven into close relationship with
the stage&mdash;the “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Ritterballet</span>,” produced by the nobility on Carnival
Sunday, March 6, 1791, and which, consequently, cannot have
been composed long before, say in 1790 or 1791. The ballet was
designed by Count Waldstein in connection with Habich, a
dancing-master from Aix-la-Chapelle. Of the contents of the piece
we know nothing more than is contained in the report from Bonn
printed three chapters back, namely, that it illustrated the predilection
of the ancient Germans for war, the chase, love and
drinking; the music, being without words, can give us no further
help. It consists of eight short numbers, designed to accompany
the pantomime: 1, March; 2, German Song;<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> 3, Hunting Song;
4, Romance; 5, War Song; 6, Drinking Song; 7, German Dance;
8, Coda. It was intended that the music should be accepted as
Waldstein’s and, therefore, Beethoven never published it.</p>

<p>It seems as if the last year of Beethoven’s sojourn in Bonn
was especially influential in the development of his artistic character
and ability. Of the works of 1792, besides trifles, there
were two of larger dimensions which, if we were not better advised,
would unhesitatingly be placed in the riper Vienna period. The
autograph of the Octet for wind-instruments, published after the
composer’s death and designated at a later date as Op.&nbsp;103, bears
the inscription “Parthia in Es” (above this, “dans un Concert”),
“<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Due Oboe, Due Clarinetti, Due Corni, Due Fagotti di L. v.
Beethoven</span>.” From a sketch which precedes suggestions for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
song “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Feuerfarbe</span>,” Nottebohm concludes that the Octet was
composed in 1792, or, at the latest in 1793. In the latter case it
would be a Viennese product. It is improbable, however, that
Beethoven found either incentive or occasion soon after reaching
Vienna to write a piece of this character, and it is significant that
in his later years he never returned to a combination of eight instruments.
But there was an incentive in Bonn in the form of
the excellent dinner-music of the Elector described by Chaplain
Junker, which was performed by two oboes, two clarinets, two
horns and two bassoons. It may be set down as a fruit of 1792,
his last year in Bonn. For the same combination of instruments,
Beethoven also composed a Rondino in E-flat, published in 1829
by Diabelli, probably from the posthumous manuscript. From
the autograph Nottebohm argued that it was written in Bonn,
and what has been said of the origin of the Octet applies also to
the Rondino. The autograph of a little duet in G for two flutes
bears the inscription: “For Friend Degenharth by L. v. Beethoven.
August 23rd, 1792, midnight.”</p>

<p>We are lifted to a higher plane again by a work which in
invention and construction surpasses the compositions already
mentioned and still to be mentioned in the present category, and
discloses the fully developed Beethoven as we know him&mdash;the
Trio in E-flat, for violin, viola and violoncello, Op.&nbsp;3. Its publication
was announced by Artaria in February, 1797. According
to Wegeler, Beethoven was commissioned by Count Appony in
1795 to write a quartet. He made two efforts, but produced first
a Trio (Op.&nbsp;3), and then a Quintet (Op.&nbsp;4). We know better the
origin of the latter work now; but Wegeler is also mistaken about
the origin of the Trio; it was a Bonn product. Here the proof:</p>

<p>At the general flight from Bonn, whether the one at the end
of October or that of December 15, 1793, the Elector ordered his
chaplain, Abbé Clemens Dobbeler, to accompany an English lady,
the Honourable Mrs. Bowater, to Hamburg. “While there,” says
William Gardiner in his “Music and Friends,” III, 142, “he was
declared an emigrant and his property was seized. Luckily he
placed some money in our (English) government funds, and his
only alternative was to proceed to England.” Dobbeler accompanied
Mrs. Bowater to Leicester. She,</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>having lived much in Germany, had acquired a fine taste in music; and
as the Abbé was a very fine performer on the violin, music was essential
to fill up this irksome period (while Mrs. Bowater lived in lodgings
before moving into old Dolby Hall). My company was sought with that
of two of my friends to make up occasionally an instrumental quartett.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>...
Our music consisted of the Quartetts of Haydn, Boccherini,
and Wranizky. The Abbé, who never travelled without his violin,
had luckily put into his fiddle-case a Trio composed by Beethoven, just
before he set off, which thus, in the year 1793, found its way to Leicester.
This composition, so different from anything I had ever heard, awakened
in me a new sense, a new delight in the science of sounds.... When
I went to town (London) I enquired for the works of this author, but
could learn nothing more than that he was considered a madman and
that his music was like himself. However, I had a friend in Hamburg
through whom, although the war was raging at the time, I occasionally
obtained some of these inestimable treasures.</p></div>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">The Trio for Strings, Op.&nbsp;3</span></div>

<p>What trio was this so praised by the enthusiastic Englishman?
On the last page but one of Gardiner’s “Italy, her Music, Arts
and People” he writes, speaking of his return down the Rhine:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Recently we arrived at Bonn, the birthplace of Beethoven. About
the year 1786, my friend the Abbé Dobler, chaplain to the Elector of
Cologne, first noticed this curly, blackheaded boy, the son of a tenor
singer in the cathedral. Through the Abbé I became acquainted with
the first production of this wonderful composer. How great was my
surprise in playing the viola part to his Trio in E-flat, so unlike anything
I had ever heard. It was a new sense to me, an intellectual pleasure
which I had never received from sounds.</p></div>

<p>Again, in a letter to Beethoven, Gardiner says, “Your Trio
in E-flat (for violin, viola and bass).” To all but the blind this
narrative pours a flood of light upon the whole question.<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a></p>

<p>There come up now for consideration the compositions in
which Beethoven’s principal instrument, the pianoforte, is employed.
They carry us back a space, and to the earliest examples
we add a related composition for violin.</p>

<p>It was a part of Beethoven’s official duty to play pianoforte
before the Elector, and it may therefore easily be imagined that
after his first boyish attempt in 1784, he would continue to compose
concertos and parts of concertos for the pianoforte and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
orchestra, and not wait until 1795, when he publicly performed
the “entirely new” concerto in B-flat. Quite recently the world
has learned of a first movement for a pianoforte concerto in D, concerning
which the first report was made by Guido Adler in 1888,
and which was performed in Vienna on April 7, 1889, and then
incorporated, as edited by Adler, in the supplement to the Complete
Works. It was discovered in copy, solo and orchestra parts,
in the possession of Joseph Bezeczny, the head of an educational
institution for the blind in Prague, and the handwriting is his.
Immediately after its first performance its authenticity was questioned
by Dr. Paumgartner, who called attention to its Mozartian
characteristics, but failed to advance any reason for doubting the
testimony of so thorough a musical scholar as Adler. The latter
had emphasized the resemblances to Mozart’s works, which, indeed,
are too obvious to escape attention; but for a long time after 1785,
especially after Beethoven met Mozart personally in Vienna, the
former was completely in the latter’s thrall, and that his music
should occasionally be reminiscent of his model is not at all
singular. Such reminiscences are to be found in the quartets of
1785 and the trio for pianoforte and wind-instruments. It is
safe to assume that the movement was written, as Adler suggests,
in the period 1788-1793, perhaps before rather than after
1790, and that Beethoven attached little value to it and laid it
permanently aside.</p>

<p>A companion-piece to this movement is the fragment of a
Concerto for Violin in C major, of which the autograph is in the
archives of the <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Gesellschaft der Musikfreunde</span> in Vienna, the handwriting
of which indicates that it belongs to the early Vienna if
not the Bonn period. That it is a first transcription is indicated
by the fact that there are many erasures and corrections. The
fragment contains 259 measures, embracing the orchestral introduction,
the first solo passage, the second <i>tutti</i> and the beginning
of the free fantasia for the solo instrument; it ends with the introduction
of a new transition <i>motif</i> which leads to the conjecture
that the movement was finished and that the missing portion has
been lost.<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a></p>

<p>A Trio in E-flat for Pianoforte, Violin and Violoncello, found
among Beethoven’s posthumous papers, was published in 1836
by Dunst in Frankfort-on-the-Main. On the original publication
its authenticity was certified to by Diabelli, Czerny and
Ferdinand Ries, and it was stated that the original manuscript<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
was in the possession of Schindler; Wegeler verified the handwriting
as that of Beethoven. Schindler cites Beethoven’s utterance
that he had written the work at the age of 15 years and described
it as one of his “highest strivings in the free style of composition,”
which was either a misunderstanding of Schindler’s or a
bit of irony on the part of Beethoven. Nearer the truth, at any
rate, is a remark in Gräffer’s written catalogue of Beethoven’s
works: “Composed <i>anno</i> 1791, and originally intended for the
three trios, Op.&nbsp;1, but omitted as too weak by Beethoven.”
Whether or not this observation rests on an authentic source is
not stated.<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a></p>

<p>Whether or not the Pianoforte Trios, Op.&nbsp;1, were composed
in Bonn may be left without discussion here, since we shall be
obliged to recur to the subject later. The facts about them that
have been determined beyond controversy are, that they were
published in 1795; were not ready in their final shape in 1794;
and were already played in the presence of Haydn in 1793.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Other Works Composed in Bonn</span></div>

<p>The Variations in E-flat for Pianoforte, Violin and Violoncello,
which were published in 1804 by Hofmeister in Leipsic as Op.&nbsp;44,
apparently belong to the last year of Beethoven’s life in Bonn.
Nottebohm found a sketch of the work alongside one of the song
“<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Feuerfarbe</span>,” which fact points to the year 1792; Beethoven in
a letter to the publisher appears not to have laid particular store
by it, a circumstance easily understood in view of the great works
which had followed the youthful effort.</p>

<p>Besides these compositions, a Trio for Pianoforte, Flute and
Bassoon,<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> concerning which all the information which we have
came from the catalogue of Beethoven’s effects sold at auction,
has recently been published. It is No. 179 in the catalogue, where
it is described as a composition of the Bonn period. On the autograph,
preserved in Berlin, the title, placed at the end, is “<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Trio
concertante a clavicembalo, flauto, fagotto, composto da Ludovico
van Beethoven organista di S. S. (illegible word), cologne.</span>” The
designation of the composer as organist, etc., fixes the place of
its origin, and the handwriting indicates an early date.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span></p>

<p>Among the papers found in Beethoven’s apartments after
his death, was the manuscript of a Sonata in B-flat for Pianoforte
and Flute, which passed into the hands of Artaria. It is not in
Beethoven’s handwriting, and the little evidence of its authenticity
is not convincing.<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a></p>

<p>It is more than likely that the Variations for Pianoforte and
Violin on Mozart’s “<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Se vuol ballare</span>” ought to be assigned to the
latter part of the Bonn period. They were published in July, 1793,
with a dedication to Eleonore von Breuning, to whom Beethoven
sent the composition with a letter dated November 2, 1793.<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> The
dedication leads to the presumption that the work was carried
to Vienna in a finished state and there subjected to only the final
polish. The postscript to the letter to Fräulein von Breuning
betrays the reason for the hurried publication: Beethoven wanted
to checkmate certain Viennese pianists whom he had detected
copying peculiarities of his playing in improvisation which he
suspected they would publish as their own devices.</p>

<p>Besides the pieces already mentioned, Beethoven wrote the
following works for pianoforte in Bonn:</p>

<p>1. A Prelude in F minor.<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> According to a remark on a printed
copy shown to be authentic, Beethoven wrote it when he was 15
year old, that is, in 1786 or, the question of his age not being
determined at the time, 1787. The prelude is, as a matter of
fact, a fruit of his studies in the art of imitation; and the initiative,
probably, came from Bach’s Preludes.</p>

<p>2. Two Preludes through the Twelve Major Keys for Pianoforte
or Organ; published by Hoffmeister in 1803 as Op.&nbsp;39.
Obviously exercises written for Neefe while he was Beethoven’s
teacher in composition.</p>

<p>3. Variations on the arietta “<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Venni Amore</span>,” by Righini,
in D major&mdash;“<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Venni Amore</span>,” not “<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Vieni</span>”; the arietta begins:
“<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Venni Amore nel tuo regno, ma compagno del Timor</span>.” Righini
gave his melody a number of vocal variations. Beethoven<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
republished his in Vienna in 1801 through Traeg (Complete Works,
Series 17, No. 178); composed about 1790 and published in
Mannheim in 1791. They were inscribed to Countess Hatzfeld
(<i>née</i> Countess de Girodin), who has been praised in this book as
an eminent pianist. The story of the encounter between Beethoven
and Sterkel in which these variations figure has also been
told. Beethoven had a good opinion of them; Czerny told Otto
Jahn that he had brought them with him to Vienna and used them
to “introduce” himself.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Pianoforte Variations and a Sonata</span></div>

<p>Two books of variations are to be adjudged to the Bonn
period because of their place of publication and other biographical
considerations. They are the Variations in A major on a theme
from Dittersdorf’s opera “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Das rothe Käppchen</span>” (“<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Es war einmal
ein alter Mann</span>”) and the Variations for four hands on a theme by
Count Waldstein. Both sets were published by Simrock in Bonn,
the first of Beethoven’s compositions published in his native town.
They were not published until 1794, but according to a letter to
Simrock, dated August 2, 1794, the latter had received the first set
a considerable time before, and Beethoven had held back the
corrections while the other was already printed. Beethoven’s
intimate association with Waldstein in Bonn is a familiar story,
but we hear nothing of it in the early Viennese days. The variations
on a theme of his own seem likely to have been the product
of a wish expressed by the Count. That Beethoven seldom wrote
for four hands, and certainly not without a special reason, is an
accepted fact.<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a></p>

<p>Another presumably Bonnian product which has come down
to us only as a fragment is the Sonata in C major for Pianoforte,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
published in 1830 by Dunst in Frankfort, with a dedication to
Eleonore von Breuning. It is probably the sonata which Beethoven,
according to the letter to be given presently, had promised
to his friend and which was fully sketched at the time. There
would be no doubt of the fact that the sonata was written in
Bonn if the presumption that the letter was written in Bonn
were true; but even as it is, the fact that the letter says that it
had been promised “long ago” indicates a pre-Viennese origin.
All that is certain is that Eleonore von Breuning received it from
Beethoven in 1796. In the copy sent to the publisher eleven
measures at the end of the <i>Adagio</i> were lacking. These were supplied
by Ferdinand Ries in the manner of Beethoven. There can
scarcely be a doubt that Beethoven finished the <i>Adagio</i>, and it
can be assumed that he also composed a last movement, which
has been lost.</p>

<p>Concerning the Rondo in C major published in Bossler’s
“<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Blumenlese</span>” of 1783, we have already spoken.<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a></p>

<p>It is a striking fact to any one who has had occasion to examine
carefully the chronology of publication of Beethoven’s works,
that up to nearly the close of 1802 whatever appeared under his
name was worthy of that name; but that then, in the period of
the second, third and fourth symphonies, of the sonatas. Op.&nbsp;47,
53, 57 and of “Leonore,” to the wonder of the critics of that time
serial advertisements of the “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Kunst- und Industrie-Comptoir</span>” in
Vienna announce the Trios, Op.&nbsp;30 and the seven Bagatelles,
Op.&nbsp;33; in another the “Grand Sinfonie,” Op.&nbsp;36, and the Variations
on “God save the King”; on May 15, 1805, the Waldstein Sonata
and the Romance, Op.&nbsp;50; and on June 16 the songs. Op.&nbsp;52, which
the “Allgemeine Mus. Zeitung” describes as “commonplace, poor,
weak, in part ridiculous stuff.” Ries solves the enigma when he
writes (“<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Notizen</span>,” 124) that all trifles, many things which he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
never intended to publish because he deemed them unworthy of
his name, were given to the world through the agency of his brother.
In this manner the world was made acquainted with songs which
he had written long before he went to Vienna from Bonn. Even
little compositions which he had written in albums were filched
and published.</p>

<p>But even if the widest latitude be given to the judgment in
selecting from the publications of these years’ works belonging to
the Bonn period, still what an exceedingly meagre list is the aggregate
of Beethoven’s compositions from his twelfth to the end of
his twenty-second year! Mozart’s, according to Köchel, reach at
that age 293; Handel completed his twentieth year, February
23, 1705; on the twenty-fifth his second opera “Nero” was performed.
And what had he not previously written!</p>

<p>This apparent lack of productiveness on the part of Beethoven
has been noticed by other writers. One has disputed the
fact and is of opinion that the composer in later years destroyed
the manuscripts of his youth to prevent the possibility of injury
to his fame by their posthumous publication. But this explanation
is nonsense, as every one knows who has had an opportunity
to examine the autograph collections in Vienna and there to remark
with what scrupulous care even his most valueless productions
were preserved by their author in all his migrations from
house to house and from city to country throughout his Vienna
life.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Beethoven attached absolutely no value to his autographs; after
they had once been engraved they generally were piled on the floor in
his living room or an anteroom among other pieces of music. I often
brought order into his music, but when Beethoven hunted for anything,
everything was sent flying in disorder. At that time I might have carried
away the autograph manuscripts of all the pieces which had been printed,
or had I asked him for them he would unquestionably have given them
to me without a thought.</p></div>

<p>These words of Ries are confirmed by the small number of
autographs of printed works in the auction catalogue of Beethoven’s
posthumous papers&mdash;most of them having remained in
the hands of the publishers or having been lost, destroyed or
stolen.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Works Taken to Vienna From Bonn</span></div>

<p>Another author has endeavored to supply the vacuum by
deducing the chronology of Beethoven’s works from their form,
matter or general character as viewed by his eyes, referring all
which seem to him below the standard of the composer at any
particular period to an earlier one; and a very comical chronology<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
he makes of it. His success certainly has not been such as to
induce any attempt of the kind here; and yet that he is right in
the general fact is the hypothesis which the following remarks
are conceived to establish as truth. Schindler&mdash;who is often very
positive on the ground that what he does not know cannot be
true&mdash;in introducing his chronological table of Beethoven’s works,
published from 1796 to 1800, remarks: “It may be asserted with
positiveness that none of the works catalogued below were composed
before 1794”; upon which point the assertion is ventured
that Schindler is thoroughly mistaken and that many of the works
published by Beethoven during the first dozen years of his Vienna
life were taken thither from Bonn. They doubtless were more
or less altered, amended, improved, corrected, but nevertheless
belong as compositions to those years when “Beethoven played
pianoforte concertos, and Herr Neefe accompanied at Court in
the theatre and in concerts.” While the other young men were
trying their strength upon works for the orchestra and stage, the
performance of which would necessarily give them notoriety, the
Court Pianist would naturally confine himself mostly to his own
instrument and to chamber music&mdash;to works whose production
before a small circle in the salons of the Elector, Countess Hatzfeld
and others would excite little if any public notice. But here he
struck out so new, and at that time so strange a path that no
small degree of praise is due to the sagacity of Count Waldstein,
who comprehended his aims, felt his greatness and encouraged
him to trust to and be guided by his own instincts and
genius.</p>

<p>That Beethoven also tried his powers in a wider field we know
from the two cantatas, the airs in “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Die schöne Schusterin</span>” and
the “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Ritterballet</span>.” Carl Haslinger in Vienna also possessed an
orchestral introduction to the second act of an unnamed opera
which may as well be referred to the Bonn period as to any other;
and it is not by any means a wild suggestion that he had tried his
strength in other concertos for pianoforte and full orchestra than
that of 1784. As to the compositions for two, six or eight wind-instruments
there was little if any danger of mistake in supposing
them to have been written for the Elector’s “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Harmonie-Musik</span>.”
But this is wandering from the point; to establish which the
following remarks are in all humility submitted:</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Creative Industry in Bonn</span></div>

<p>I. If a list be drawn up of Beethoven’s compositions published
between 1795 and December, 1802, with the addition of
other works known to have been composed in those years, the
result will be nearly as follows (omitting single songs and other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
minor pieces): symphonies, 2; ballet (“Prometheus”), 1; sonatas
(solo and duo), 32; romances (violin and orchestra), 2; serenade,
1; duos (clarinet and bassoon), 3; sets of variations, 15; sets
of dances, 5; “Ah! perfido” and “Adelaide,” 2; pianoforte concertos,
3; trios (pianoforte and other instruments), 9; quartets,
6; quintets, 3; septet, 1; pianoforte rondos, 3; marches (for
four hands), 3; oratorio (“Christus”), 1; an aggregate of 92 compositions
in eight years or ninety-six months. And most of them
such compositions! That Beethoven was a remarkable man all
the world knows; but that he could produce at this rate, study
operatic composition with Salieri, sustain, nay, increase his reputation
as a pianoforte virtuoso, journey to Prague, Berlin and
other places, correct proof-sheets for his publishers, give lessons
and yet find time to write long letters to friends, to sleep, to eat,
drink and be merry with companions of his own age&mdash;this is, to
say the least, “a morsel difficult of digestion.” The more so from
the fact that at the very time when he began to devote himself
more exclusively to composition such marvellous fertility suddenly
ceased. The inference is obvious.</p>

<p>II. When Neefe, in 1798, calls Beethoven “beyond controversy
one of the foremost pianoforte players,” it excites no surprise.
Ten years before he had played the most of Bach’s “Well-Tempered
Clavichord” and had now long held the offices of Second Court
Organist and Concerto Player; but what sufficient reason could
Waldstein have had for his faith that this pianist, by study and
perseverance, would yet be able to seize and hold the sceptre of
Mozart? And upon what grounds, too, could Fischenich, on
January 26, 1793, write as he did to Charlotte von Schiller
from Bonn (see <i>ante</i>) and add, “I expect something perfect
from him, for so far as I know him he is wholly devoted
to the great and sublime.... Haydn has written here that
he would soon put him at grand operas and soon be obliged to
quit composing.”</p>

<p>Note the date of this&mdash;January 26, 1793. Haydn must have
written some time before this, when Beethoven could not have
been with him more than six or eight weeks. Did the master
found his remark upon what he had seen in his pupil or upon the
compositions which his pupil had placed before him? Wegeler
has printed an undated and incomplete letter of Beethoven to
Eleonore von Breuning, certainly, however, not later than the
spring of 1794, which was accompanied by a set of variations and
a rondo for pianoforte and violin. Do the following passages
in this letter indicate anything?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I have a great deal to do or I would before this have transcribed
the sonata <i>which I promised you long ago</i>. It is a mere sketch in my
manuscript and it would be a difficult task even for the clever and practised
Paraquin to copy it. You can have the rondo copied and return
the score to me. It is the only one of my things which is, in a manner,
suitable to you.</p></div>

<p>May these words not be paraphrased thus: “As to the sonata
which I played at your house and of which I promised you a copy&mdash;it
is in my manuscript hardly more than a sketch, so that I
could not trust it to a copyist, not even to Paraquin, and I have
not had leisure to transcribe it myself.” And, finally, the closing
lines of a short article in the “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Jahrbuch der Tonkunst für Wien
und Prag</span>,” 1776&mdash;which notice was not written later than the
spring of 1795, nine or ten months before the publication of the
Sonatas Op.&nbsp;2&mdash;are pregnantly suggestive: “We have a number
of beautiful sonatas by him, amongst which the last ones particularly
distinguish themselves.” These works were, therefore,
well-known in manuscript even at the time when he was busy
with his studies under Haydn and Albrechtsberger.</p>

<p>III. If in spite of the above it still be objected that the <i>opera</i>
1 to 15, or 20, as you please, are of a character beyond the powers
of Beethoven during his Bonn life, who <i>knows</i> this to be a fact?
Has such an objection any other basis than a mere prejudice?</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Evidences of Early Activity</span></div>

<p>A fanciful theory has exhibited Beethoven to us as a rude, undeveloped
genius, who, being transferred to Vienna and schooled
two years by Haydn and Albrechtsberger, then began with the
Trios Op.&nbsp;1, wrought his way upward in eight years through the
twenty-three compositions of <i>opera</i> 2 to 14 in a geometrical progression
to the first pianoforte concertos, the ballet “Prometheus”
and the Symphony in C! It is, however, known that in March,
1795, Beethoven played his Pianoforte Concerto in B-flat in Vienna,
shortly afterward published the Trios, Op.&nbsp;1, and in 1796 composed
the two sonatas for pianoforte and violoncello in Berlin. A young
man who at the age of 24 or 25 could give the public two such
concertos could hardly have been such a rough diamond only
three or four years before.</p>

<p>IV. However convincing the preceding propositions may
seem to the ordinary reader, the critical student of musical history
justly demands something more. It is not enough for him to
know that Op.&nbsp;19 was composed before the publication of Op.&nbsp;1;
that Op.&nbsp;2 is in part made up from the Pianoforte Quartets of 1785;
that the Quintet Op.&nbsp;4 is an arrangement of the “Parthia” in E-flat
for wind-instruments afterwards published as Op.&nbsp;103, and is now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
proved to belong to the Bonn period, and that a whole movement
of the funeral cantata found its way into “Fidelio”&mdash;the argument
is to him like an arch without its keystone until one or more of
the important works be named specifically as Bonn compositions
and proved to be such.<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Beethoven Settles Down in Vienna</span></div>

<p>It would be pleasant to announce the arrival of Ludwig van
Beethoven in Vienna with, so to speak, a grand flourish of
trumpets, and to indulge the fancy in a highly-colored and
poetic account of his advent there; but, unluckily, there is none
of that lack of data which is favorable to that kind of composition;
none of that obscurity which exalts one to write history as he
would have it and not as it really was. The facts are too patent.
Like the multitude of studious youths and young men who came
thither annually to find schools and teachers, this small, thin,
dark-complexioned, pockmarked, dark-eyed, bewigged young
musician of 22 years had quietly journeyed to the capital to
pursue the study of his art with a small, thin, dark-complexioned,
pockmarked, black-eyed and bewigged veteran composer. In
the well-known anecdote related by Carpani of Haydn’s introduction
to him, Anton Esterhazy, the prince, is made to call the
composer “a Moor.” Beethoven had even more of the Moor in
his looks than his master. His front teeth, owing to the singular
flatness of the roof of his mouth, protruded, and, of course,
thrust out his lips; the nose, too, was rather broad and decidedly
flattened, while the forehead was remarkably full and round&mdash;in
the words of the late Court Secretary, Mähler, who twice
painted his portrait, a “bullet.”</p>

<p>“Beethoven,” wrote Junker, “confessed that in his journeys
he had seldom found in the playing of the most distinguished
virtuosos that excellence which he supposed he had a right to
expect.” He now had an opportunity to make his observations
upon the pianists and composers at the very headquarters, then, of
German music, to improve himself by study under the best of them
and, by and by, to measure his strength with theirs. He found
very soon that the words of the poet were here also applicable:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p>

<p>“’Tis distance lends enchantment to the view,” and did not
find&mdash;now Mozart was gone&mdash;“what he supposed he had a right
to expect.” For the present, however, we have to do but with
the young stranger in a large city, seeking lodgings, and making
such arrangements for the future as shall not be out of due proportion
to the limited pecuniary means at his command. If the
minute details which here follow should seem to be too insignificant
in themselves, the bearing they have upon some other future
questions must justify their introduction.</p>

<p>Turning again to the memorandum book, the first entries
which follow the notes of the journey from Bonn to Würges are
merely of necessities to be supplied&mdash;“wood, wig-maker, coffee,
overcoat, boots, shoes, pianoforte-desk, seal, writing-desk, pianoforte-money”
and something illegible followed by the remark: “All
beginning with next month.” The next page gives a hint as to
the day of his arrival. It contains the substance of two advertisements
in the “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Wiener Zeitung</span>” of pianofortes for sale, one
near the Hohen Markt and two “im Kramerschen Breihaus No.
257 im Schlossergassel, am Graben.” The latter appears <i>for the
last time</i> on the 10th of November; Beethoven was, therefore,
then in Vienna.</p>

<p>But he intends to cultivate the Graces as well as the Muses.
The next page begins with this: “Andreas Lindner, dancing-master,
lives in the Stoss am Himmel, No. 415,” to which succeeds a note,
evidently of money received from the Elector, possibly in Bonn
but more likely in Vienna: “25 ducats received of which, expended
on November (?) half a sovereign for the pianoforte, or 6 florins,
40 kreutzer&mdash;2 florins were of my own money.” The same page
also shows him in the matter of his toilet preparing even then for
entrance into society: “Black silk stockings, 1 ducat; 1 pair of
winter silk stockings, 1 florin, 40 kreutzers; boots, 6 florins; shoes,
1 florin, 30 kreutzers.” But these expenses in addition to his daily
necessities are making a large inroad upon his “25 ducats received”;
and on page 7 we read: “On Wednesday the 12th of December,
I had 15 ducats.” (The 12th of December fell upon Wednesday
in the year 1792.) Omitting for the present what else stands upon
page 7, here are the interesting contents of page 8&mdash;and how suggestive
and pregnant they are: “In Bonn I counted on receiving
100 ducats here; but in vain. I have got to equip myself completely
anew.”</p>

<p>Several pages which follow contain what, upon inspection,
proves evidently to be his monthly payments from the time when
“all was to begin next month,” of which the first may be given as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
a specimen: “House-rent, 14 florins; pianoforte, 6 florins, 49
kreutzers; eating, each time 12 kreutzers; meals with wine 6
and one-half florins; 3 kreutzers for B. and H.; it is not necessary
to give the housekeeper more than 7 florins, the rooms are so close
to the ground.”<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Death of Johann van Beethoven</span></div>

<p>Beethoven was hardly well settled in his lodgings, the novelty
of his position had scarcely begun to wear off under the effect of
habit, when startling tidings reached him from Bonn of an event
to cloud his Christmas holidays, to weaken his ties to his native
place, to increase his cares for his brothers and make an important
change in his pecuniary condition. His father had suddenly died&mdash;“1792,
Dec. 18, <i>obiit</i> Johannes Beethoff,” says the death-roll
of St. Remigius parish. The Elector-Archbishop, still in Münster,
heard this news also and consecrated a joke to the dead man’s
memory. On the 1st of January, 1793, he wrote a letter to Court
Marshal von Schall in which these words occur:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The revenues from the liquor excise have suffered a loss in the
deaths of Beethoven and Eichhoff. For the widow of the latter, provision
will be made if circumstances allow in view of his 40 years of service&mdash;in
the electoral kitchen.</p></div>

<p>Franz Ries was again to befriend Beethoven and act for him
in his absence, and the receipt for his first quarter’s salary (25 th.)
is signed “F. Ries, in the name of Ludwig Beethoven,” at the
usual time, namely the beginning of the second month of the
quarter, February 4. But the lapse of Johann van Beethoven’s
pension of 200 thalers, was a serious misfortune to his son, particularly
since the 100 ducats were not forthcoming. The correspondence
between Beethoven and Ries not being preserved it
can only be conjectured that the latter took the proper steps to
obtain that portion of the pension set apart by the electoral
decree for the support of the two younger sons; but in vain,
owing to the disappearance of the original document; and that,
receiving information of this fact, Beethoven immediately sent
from Vienna the petition which follows, but which, as is mostly
the case with that class of papers in the Bonn archives, is
without date:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquot">

<p>Several years ago Your Serene Electoral Highness was graciously
pleased to retire my father, the tenor singer van Beethoven, from service,
and to set aside 100 thalers of his salary to me that I might clothe,
nourish and educate my two younger brothers and also pay the debts
of my father.</p>

<p>I was about to present this decree to Your Highness’s Revenue
Exchequer when my father urgently begged me not to do so inasmuch
as it would have the appearance in the eyes of the public as if he were
incapable of caring for his family, adding that he would himself pay me
the 25 thalers quarterly, which he always did.</p>

<p>When, however, on the death of my father (in December of last
year) I wished to make use of Your Highness’s grace by presenting the
above-mentioned gracious decree I learned to my terror, that my father
had misapplied (<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">unterschlagen</i> = to embezzle) the same.</p>

<p>In most obedient veneration I therefore pray Your Electoral Highness
for the gracious renewal of this decree and that Your Highness’s
Revenue Exchequer be directed to pay over to me the sum graciously
allowed to me due for the last quarter at the beginning of last February.</p>

<p class="sig">

father; he is further to receive the three measures of
grain graciously bestowed upon him for the education
of his brothers.” The Electoral Court Chancellory
will make the necessary provisions. Attest p.</div></div></div>

<p>The order to the exchequer followed on May 24th, and on
June 15th, Franz Ries had the satisfaction of signing receipts&mdash;one
for 25 thalers for January, February and March, and one for
50 thalers for the second quarter of the year; but from this time
onward no hint has yet been discovered that Beethoven ever
received anything from the Elector or had any resources but his
own earnings and the generosity of newly-found friends in Vienna.
These resources were soon needed. The remark that two florins
of the payment towards the pianoforte were out of his own money
proves that he possessed a small sum saved up by degrees from
lesson-giving, from presents received and the like; but it could
not have been a large amount, while the 25 ducats and the above
recorded receipts of salary were all too small to have carried him
through the summer of 1793. Here is the second of his monthly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
records of necessary and regular expenses in farther proof of this:
“14 florins house-rent; 6 fl. 40 x, pianoforte; meals with wine,
15 fl. and a half;&mdash;(?), 3 florins; maid, 1,” the sum total being
as added by himself “11 ducats and one-half florin.” And yet
at the end of the year there are entries that show that he was not
distressed for money. For instance: “the 24th October, i.e., reckoning
from November 1st, 112 florins and 30 kreutzer”; “2 ducats
for a seal; 1 florin, 25 kreutzers, copyist”; “Tuesday and Saturday
from 7 to 8. Sunday from 11 to 12, 3 florins”; and the final entry
not later in date than 1794 is: “3 carolins in gold, 4 carolins in
crown thalers and 4 ducats make 7 carolins and 4 ducats and a
lot of small change.”</p>

<p>In what manner Beethoven was already in 1794 able to remain
“in Vienna without salary until recalled,” to quote the Elector’s
words, will hereafter appear with some degree of certainty; but
just now he claims attention as pupil of Haydn and Albrechtsberger.
The citations made in a previous chapter from the letters
of Neefe and Fischenich prove how strong an impression Beethoven’s
powers, both as virtuoso and composer, had made upon
Joseph Haydn immediately after his reaching Vienna; and no
man then living was better able to judge on such points. But
whether the famous chapelmaster, just returned from his English
triumphs, himself a daring and successful innovator and now very
busy with compositions in preparation for his second visit to
London, was the man to guide the studies of a headstrong, self-willed
and still more daring musical revolutionist was, <i>a priori</i>, a
very doubtful question. The result proved that he was not.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Beethoven’s Studies With Haydn</span></div>

<p>The memorandum book has a few entries which relate to
Haydn. On page 7, that which contains the 15 ducats on the
12th of October, 1792, there is a column of numerals, the first of
which reads, “Haidn 8 groschen”; the other twelve, except a single
“1,” all “2”; and on the two pages which happen to have the
dates of October 24 and 29, 1793, are these two entries: “22 x,
chocolate for Haidn and me”; “Coffee, 6 x for Haidn and me.”
These notes simply confirm what was known from other sources,
namely, that Beethoven began to study with Haydn very soon
after reaching Vienna and continued to be his pupil until the end
of the year 1793.<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> They indicate, also, that the scholar, whatever
feelings he may have indulged towards the master in secret, kept
on good terms with him, and that their private intercourse was
not confined to the hours devoted to lessons in Haydn’s room in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
the Hamberger house, No. 992 on the (no longer existing)
Wasserkunstbastei.</p>

<p>Concerning the course of study during that year, nothing can
be added to the words of Nottebohm (“Allg. Mus. Zeitung,”
1863-1864), founded upon a most thorough examination of all the
known manuscripts and authorities which bear upon this question.
Of the manuscripts Nottebohm says: “They are exercises in simple
counterpoint on six plain chants in the old modes.... He must
have written more.” But what? On this point there are no
indications to be found. It may be accepted with considerable
certainty that the contrapuntal exercises were preceded by an
introductory, though probably brief, study of the nature of consonances
and dissonances. For this the last chapter of the first
book of Fux’s “Gradus ad Parnassum” might have served.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>But this (adds Nottebohm) would not have sufficed to fill the entire
period. In view of Haydn’s predilection for Fux’s system it is not conceivable
that there were preliminary exercises, say in the free style or in
the modern keys; there remains, therefore, no alternative but to go
back further and opine that the study with Haydn began with the theory
of harmony and exercises in which the system of Philipp Emanuel Bach
might have been used.</p></div>

<p>“It is certain,” says Schindler, “that Beethoven’s knowledge
of the science of harmony at the time when he began his study
with Haydn did not go beyond thoroughbass.” The correctness
of this opinion of Schindler may be safely left to the judgment of
the reader. The fact seems to be that Beethoven, conscious of
the disadvantages attending the want of thorough systematic
instruction, distrustful of himself and desirous of bringing to the
test many of his novel and cherished ideas, had determined to
accomplish a complete course of contrapuntal study, and thus
renew, revise and reduce to order and system the great mass of
his previous scientific acquirements. He would, at all events,
thoroughly know and understand the <i>regular</i> that he might with
confidence judge for himself how far to indulge in the <i>irregular</i>.
To this view, long since adopted, the results of Nottebohm’s
researches add credibility. It explains, also, how a young man,
too confident in the soundness of his views to be willing to alter
his productions because they contained passages and effects censured
by those about him for being other than those of Mozart
and Haydn, was yet willing, with the modesty of true genius, to
shut them up in his writing-desk until, through study and observation,
he could feel himself standing upon the firm basis of sound<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
knowledge and then retain or exclude, according to the dictates
of an enlightened judgment.</p>

<p>Beethoven, however, very soon discovered that also in Haydn,
as a teacher, he had “not found that excellence which he supposed
he had a right to expect.” Ries remembered a remark made by
him on this point: “Haydn had wished that Beethoven might
put the word, ‘Pupil of Haydn,’ on the title of his first works.
Beethoven was unwilling to do so because, as he said, though he
had had some instruction from Haydn he had never learned anything
from him.” Still more in point is the oft-repeated story
of Johann Schenk’s kindness to Beethoven, related by Seyfried in
Gräfer’s and Schilling’s lexica and confirmed by Schindler, which,
when divested of its errors in dates, may be related thus: Among
Beethoven’s earliest acquaintances in Vienna was the Abbé Joseph
Gelinek, one of the first virtuosos then in that city and an amazingly
fruitful and popular composer of variations. It was upon
him that Carl Maria von Weber, some years afterwards, wrote
the epigram:</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza" lang="de" xml:lang="de">
<span class="i0">Kein Thema auf der Welt verschonte dein Genie,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Das simpelste allein&mdash;Dich selbst&mdash;variirst du nie!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">“No theme on earth escaped your genius airy,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">The simplest one of all&mdash;yourself&mdash;you never vary.”<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Czerny told Otto Jahn that his father once met Gelinek
tricked out in all his finery. “Whither?” he inquired. “I am asked
to measure myself with a young pianist who is just arrived; I’ll
use him up.” A few days later he met him again. “Well, how
was it?” “Ah, he is no man; he’s a devil. He will play me and
all of us to death. And how he improvises!” According to
Czerny, Gelinek remained a sworn enemy to Beethoven.</p>

<p>It was in Gelinek’s lodgings that Schenk heard Beethoven
improvise for the first time,</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>a treat which recalled lively recollections of Mozart. With many manifestations
of displeasure, Beethoven, always eager to learn, complained
to Gelinek that he was never able to make any progress in his contrapuntal
studies under Haydn, since the master, too variously occupied,
was unable to pay the amount of attention which he wanted to the
exercises he had given him to work out. Gelinek spoke on the subject
with Schenk and asked him if he did not feel disposed to give Beethoven
a course in composition. Schenk declared himself willing, with ready
courtesy, but only under two conditions: that it should be without
compensation of any kind and under the strict seal of secrecy. The
mutual agreement was made and kept with conscientious fidelity.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>

<p>Thus far Seyfried; we shall now permit Schenk to tell his
own story:<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In 1792, His Royal Highness Archduke Maximilian, Elector of
Cologne, was pleased to send his charge Louis van Beethoven to Vienna
to study musical composition with Haydn. Towards the end of July,
Abbé Gelinek informed me that he had made the acquaintance of a young
man who displayed extraordinary virtuosity on the pianoforte, such,
indeed, as he had not observed since Mozart. In passing he said that
Beethoven had been studying counterpoint with Haydn for more than
six months and was still at work on the first exercise; also that His
Excellency Baron van Swieten had earnestly recommended the study
of counterpoint and frequently inquired of him how far he had advanced
in his studies. As a result of these frequent incitations and the fact
that he was still in the first stages of his instruction, Beethoven, eager
to learn, became discontented and often gave expression to his dissatisfaction
to his friend. Gelinek took the matter much to heart and came
to me with the question whether I felt disposed to assist his friend in
the study of counterpoint. I now desired to become better acquainted
with Beethoven as soon as possible, and a day was fixed for me to meet
him in Gelinek’s lodgings and hear him play on the pianoforte.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Beethoven’s Improvisations</span></div>

<p>Thus I saw the composer, now so famous, for the first time and
heard him play. After the customary courtesies he offered to improvise
on the pianoforte. He asked me to sit beside him. Having struck a
few chords and tossed off a few figures as if they were of no significance,
the creative genius gradually unveiled his profound psychological pictures.
My ear was continually charmed by the beauty of the many
and varied motives which he wove with wonderful clarity and loveliness
into each other, and I surrendered my heart to the impressions made
upon it while he gave himself wholly up to his creative imagination,
and anon, leaving the field of mere tonal charm, boldly stormed the
most distant keys in order to give expression to violent passions....</p>

<p>The first thing that I did the next day was to visit the still unknown
artist who had so brilliantly disclosed his mastership. On his writing
desk I found a few passages from his first lesson in counterpoint. A
cursory glance disclosed the fact that, brief as it was, there were mistakes
in every key. Gelinek’s utterances were thus verified. Feeling sure
that my pupil was unfamiliar with the preliminary rules of counterpoint,
I gave him the familiar textbook of Joseph Fux, “Gradus ad Parnassum,”
and asked him to look at the exercises that followed. Joseph Haydn,
who had returned to Vienna towards the end of the preceding year,<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a>
was intent on utilizing his muse in the composition of large masterworks,
and thus laudably occupied could not well devote himself to the rules
of grammar. I was now eagerly desirous to become the helper of the
zealous student. But before beginning the instruction I made him
understand that our coöperation would have to be kept secret. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
view of this I recommended that he copy every exercise which I corrected
in order that Haydn should not recognize the handwriting of a stranger
when the exercise was submitted to him. After a year, Beethoven and
Gelinek had a falling out for a reason that has escaped me; both, it
seemed to me, were at fault. As a result Gelinek got angry and betrayed
my secret. Beethoven and his brothers made no secret of it longer.</p>

<p>I began my honorable office with my good Louis in the beginning
of August, 1792,<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> and filled it uninterruptedly until May, 1793,<a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> by which
time he finished double counterpoint in the octave and went to Eisenstadt.
If His Royal Highness had sent his charge at once to Albrechtsberger
his studies would never have been interrupted and he would
have completed them.</p></div>

<p>Here follows a passage, afterward stricken out by Schenk,
in which he resents the statement that Beethoven had finished
his studies with Albrechtsberger. This would have been advisable,
but if it were true, Gelinek as well as Beethoven would have
told him of the fact. “On the contrary, he admitted to me that
he had gone to Herr Salieri, Royal Imperial Chapelmaster, for
lessons in the free style of composition.” Then Schenk continues:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>About the middle of May he told me that he would soon go with
Haydn to Eisenstadt and stay there till the beginning of winter; he did
not yet know the date of his departure. I went to him at the usual hour
in the beginning of June but my good Louis was no longer to be seen. He
left for me the following little billet which I copy word for word:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="salut">
“Dear Schenk!
</p>

<p>It was not my desire to set off to-day for Eisenstadt. I should
like to have spoken with you again. Meanwhile rest assured of my
gratitude for the favors shown me. I shall endeavor with all my might
to requite them. I hope soon to see you again, and once more to enjoy
the pleasure of your society. Farewell and</p>

<p class="sig">
do not entirely forget<br />
your<br />
Beethoven.”
</p>
</div>

<p>It was my intention only briefly to touch upon my relations with
Beethoven; but the circumstances under which, and the manner in
which I became his guide in musical composition constrained me to
be somewhat more explicit. For my efforts (if they can be called efforts)
I was rewarded by my good Louis with a precious gift, viz.: a firm bond
of friendship which lasted without fading till the day of his death.</p>

<p class="sig">
Written in the summer of 1830.</p></div>

<p>A chronological difficulty is presented by Schenk’s story of
the cessation of the instruction. There can be no doubt that it
began towards the beginning of August, 1793, as confirmed by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
distinct utterance of Schenk (who errs in the year, however),
particularly by the statement that the study with Haydn had
already endured six months. Schenk’s instruction is said to have
lasted till the end of May, 1794, and the definitive mention of the
month makes an error improbable. But at this time Haydn was
already long in England, while Schenk’s narrative represents
Beethoven as saying that he intended going to Eisenstadt with
Haydn; moreover, Beethoven was already Albrechtsberger’s
pupil and as such was no longer in need of secret help. Nevertheless,
the continuance of the relations with Schenk is easily
possible and they were not likely to be interrupted so long as Beethoven
remained in Vienna; this is indicated by the reference to
double counterpoint, which Beethoven did not study under Haydn
but with Albrechtsberger; also Schenk’s intimation that if the
Elector had sent his charge “at once” to Albrechtsberger shows
that instruction with the latter had already begun. The letter to
Schenk, though cast in friendly terms, can nevertheless be interpreted
as a declination of further services, a breaking off of the
relationship between teacher and pupil, for which the journey to
Eisenstadt was a welcome excuse. But we learn only from Schenk
that Beethoven was to make the journey with Haydn, and he may
have been mistaken in this as he was in the year. It is very
conceivable that Beethoven had received an invitation to visit
him from Prince Esterhazy, who must surely have got acquainted
with him in Vienna. He who is unwilling to accept this, must
place the letter and the journey in the last months of 1793, which
is in every respect improbable.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Beethoven’s Relations with Haydn</span></div>

<p>The relations between Haydn and his pupil did not long continue
truly cordial; yet Beethoven concealed his dissatisfaction
and no break occurred. Thoughtless and reckless of consequences,
as he often in later years unfortunately exhibited himself when
indulging his wilfulness, he was at this time responsible to the
Elector for his conduct, and Haydn, moreover, was too valuable
and influential a friend to be wantonly alienated. So, whatever
feelings he cherished in secret, he kept them to himself, went regularly
to his lessons and, as noted above, occasionally treated his
master to chocolate or coffee. It was, of course, Haydn who took
the young man to Eisenstadt, and, as Neefe tells us, he wished to
take him to England. Why was that plan not carried out? Did
Maximilian forbid it? Would Beethoven’s pride not allow him
to go thither as Haydn’s pupil? Did zeal for his contrapuntal
studies prevent it? Or had his relations to the Austrian nobility
already become such as offered him higher hopes of success in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
Vienna than Haydn could propose in London? Or, finally, was
it his ambition rather to make himself known as Beethoven the
composer than as Beethoven the pianoforte virtuoso? Pecuniary
reasons are insufficient to account for the failure of the plan; for
Haydn, who now knew the London public, could easily have removed
all difficulty on that score. Neefe’s letter was written
near the end of September, 1793, when already “a number of
reports” had reached Bonn “that Beethoven had made great
progress in his art.” These “reports,” we know from Fischenich,
came in part from Haydn himself. Add to that the wish to take
his pupil with him to England&mdash;which was certainly the highest
compliment he could possibly have paid him&mdash;and the utter
groundlessness of Beethoven’s suspicions that Haydn “was not
well-minded towards him,” as Ries says in his “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Notizen</span>” (page 85),
is apparent. Yet these suspicions, added to the reasons above
suggested, sufficiently explain the departure of the master for
London without the company of his pupil, who now (January,
1794) was transferred to Albrechtsberger.</p>

<p>In the pretty extensive notes copied from the memorandum
book already so much cited, there are but two which can with
any degree of certainty be referred to a date later than 1793. One
of them is this:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
Schuppanzigh, 3 times a W. (Week?)<br />
Albrechtsberger, 3 times a W. (Week?)<br />
</div>

<p>The necessary inference from this is that Beethoven began
the year 1794 with three lessons a week in violin-playing from
Schuppanzigh (unless the youth of the latter should forbid such
an inference) and three in counterpoint from the most famous
teacher of that science. Seyfried affirms that the studies with
the latter continued “two complete years with tireless persistency.”
The coming narrative will show that other things took up much
of Beethoven’s attention in 1795, and that before the close of that
year, if not already at its beginning, his course with Albrechtsberger
ended.<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Studies with Albrechtsberger</span></div>

<p>The instruction which Beethoven received from Albrechtsberger
(and which was based chiefly on the master’s “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Anweisung
zur Komposition</span>”) began again with simple counterpoint, in which
Beethoven now received more detailed directions than had been
given by Haydn. Albrechtsberger wrote down rules for him,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
Beethoven did the same and worked out a large number of
exercises on two plain-song melodies which Albrechtsberger then
corrected according to the rules of strict writing. There followed
contrapuntal exercises in free writing, in imitation, in two-,
three- and four-part fugue, choral fugue, double counterpoint in
the different intervals, double fugue, triple counterpoint and
canon. The last was short, as here the instruction ceased.
Beethoven worked frequently in the immediate presence and
with the direct coöperation of Albrechtsberger. The latter
labored with obvious conscientiousness and care, and was ever
ready to aid his pupil. If he appears at times to have been
given over to minute detail and conventional method, it must be
borne in mind that rigid schooling in fixed rules is essential to the
development of an independent artist, even if he makes no use of
them, and that it is only in this manner that freedom in workmanship
can be achieved. Of this the youthful Beethoven was aware
and every line of his exercises bears witness that he entered into
his studies with complete interest and undivided zeal.<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> This was
particularly the case in his exercises in counterpoint and imitation,
where he strove to avoid errors, and their beneficial results
are plainly noticeable in his compositions. Several of the compositions
written after the lessons, disclose how “he was led from a
predominantly figurative to a more contrapuntal manner of
writing.” There is less of this observable in the case of fugue, in
which the instruction itself was not free from deficiencies; and the
pupil worked more carelessly. The restrictive rules occasionally
put him out of conceit with his work; “he was at the age in which,
as a rule, suggestion and incitation are preferred to instruction,”
and his stubborn nature played an important rôle in the premises.
However, it ought to be added that he was also at an age when his
genial aptness in invention and construction had already found
exercise in other directions. Even though he did not receive
thorough education in fugue from Albrechtsberger, he nevertheless
learned the constituent elements of the form and how to apply
them. Moreover, in his later years he made all these things the
subjects of earnest and devoted study independent of others; and
in the compositions of his later years he returned with special and
manifest predilection to the fugued style. Nothing could be more
incorrect than to emphasize Beethoven’s lack of theoretical education.
If, while studying with Albrechtsberger, but more particularly
in his independent compositions, Beethoven ignored many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
of the strict rules, it was not because he was not able to apply
them, but because he purposely set them aside. Places can be
found in his exercises in which the rules are violated; but the testimony
of the ear acquits the pupil. Rules are not the objects of
themselves, they do not exist for their own sake, and in despite of
all artistic systems; it is the reserved privilege of the evolution of
art-means and prescient, forward genius to point out what in
them is of permanent value, and what must be looked upon as
antiquated. Nature designed that Beethoven should employ
music in the depiction of soul-states, to emancipate melody and
express his impulses in the free forms developed by Ph. Em. Bach,
Mozart, Haydn and their contemporaries. In this direction he
had already disclosed himself as a doughty warrior before the instruction
in Vienna had its beginning, and it is very explicable
that to be hemmed in by rigid rules was frequently disagreeable
to him. He gradually wearied of “creating musical skeletons.”
But all the more worthy of recognition, yea, of admiration, is the
fact that the young composer who had already mounted so high,
should by abnegation of his creative powers surrender himself to
the tyranny of the rules and find satisfaction in conscientious
practice of them.</p>

<p>Nottebohm summed up his conclusions from the investigations
which he made of Beethoven’s posthumous papers thus:
prefacing that, after 1785, Beethoven more and more made the
manner of Mozart his own, he continues:</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">What Beethoven Learned</span></div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The instruction which he received from Haydn and Albrechtsberger
enriched him with new forms and media of expression and these
effected a change in his mode of writing. The voices acquired greater
melodic flow and independence. A certain opacity took the place of
the former transparency in the musical fabric. Out of a homophonic
polyphony of two or more voices, there grew a polyphony that was real.
The earlier obbligato accompaniment gave way to an obbligato style
of writing which rested to a greater extent on counterpoint. Beethoven
has accepted the principle of polyphony; his part-writing has become
purer and it is noteworthy that the compositions written immediately
after the lessons are among the purest that Beethoven ever composed.
True, the Mozart model still shines through the fabric, but we seek it
less in the art of figuration than in the form and other things which are
only indirectly associated with the obbligato style. Similarly, we can
speak of other influences&mdash;that of Joseph Haydn, for instance. This
influence is not contrapuntal. Beethoven built upon his acquired and
inherited possessions. He assimilated the traditional forms and means
of expression, gradually eliminated foreign influences and, following
the pressure of his subjective nature with its inclination towards the
ideal, he created his own individual style.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span></p>

<p>As is known, Seyfried in his book entitled “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Ludwig van Beethoven’s
Studien im Generalbasse</span>,” which appeared in 1832,
gathered together all that was to be found in the way of exercises,
excerpts from textbooks, etc., in Beethoven’s posthumous papers
and presented them in so confused and arbitrary a manner that
only the keenness and patience of a Nottebohm could point the
way through the maze; Seyfried would have us believe that the
entire contents of his book belonged to the studies under Albrechtsberger.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>It will require no waste of words, says Nottebohm (p. 198), to
prove the incompatibility of such a claim with the results of our investigations.
As a matter of fact, only the smallest portion of the “Studies”
can be traced back to the instruction which Beethoven received from
Albrechtsberger. The greater part had nothing to do with this instruction
and, aside from the changes made, belongs to the other labors. In
the smaller portion Seyfried made things as easy for himself as possible.
Of Beethoven’s exercises he took only such as he found cleanly copied or
legibly written, and omitted those which were difficult to decipher because
of many corrections. This is the explanation of the fact that Seyfried
did not include a single exercise in strict simple counterpoint. If all the
passages bearing on the course followed under Albrechtsberger were
brought together and all the errors made in the presentation overlooked,
we should still have but a fragmentary and faulty reflection of that
study. Neither need we enter upon a discussion of the marginal notes
attributed to Beethoven which so plentifully besprinkle Seyfried’s book.
The fact is that in all the manuscripts which belong to the studies under
Albrechtsberger not one of the “sarcastically thrown out” marginal
notes is to be found. The glosses which do appear as Beethoven’s ...
are of a wholly different character from those printed by Seyfried. They
show that Beethoven was deeply immersed and interested in the matter.
It would, indeed, be inexplicable what could have persuaded Beethoven
to continue study with a teacher with whom, as Seyfried would have us
believe, he was in conflict already at the beginning of simple counterpoint.
He had it in his power to discontinue his studies at any moment.</p></div>

<p>A doubt has been hinted above whether Beethoven’s studies
under Albrechtsberger were continued beyond the beginning of
the year 1795. If all these exercises in counterpoint, fugue and
canon, and all those excerpts from Fux, C. P. E. Bach, Türk,
Albrechtsberger, and Kirnberger, which Seyfried made the basis
of his “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Studien</span>”&mdash;and mingled in a confusion inextricable by any
one possessing less learning, patience, sagacity and perseverance
than Nottebohm&mdash;had already belonged to the period of his pupilage,
their quantity alone, taken in connection with the writer’s
other occupations, would indeed preclude such a doubt; but
knowing that perhaps the greater portion of those manuscripts
belongs to a period many years later, and considering the great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
facility in writing which Beethoven had already acquired before
coming to Vienna, there seems to be no indication of any course
of study which might not easily be completed during the one year
with Haydn (and Schenk) and one year with Albrechtsberger.
Schönfeld, in the “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Jahrbuch der Tonkunst für Wien und Prag</span>,”
supposes that Beethoven was still the pupil of the latter at the
time when he wrote, which was in the spring of 1795. His words
are: “An eloquent proof of his [Beethoven’s] real love of art is
the circumstance that he has placed himself in the hands of our
immortal Haydn, in order to be initiated into the sacred mysteries
of composition. This great master has, in his absence, turned
him over to our great Albrechtsberger.” There is nothing decisive
in this; and yet it is all that appears to confirm the “two years”
of Seyfried; while on the other hand Wegeler, who, during all the
year 1795, was much with Beethoven, has nowhere in his “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Notizen</span>”
any allusion whatever to his friend as being still a student under
a master.</p>

<p>Referring to the number of pages (160) of exercises and the
three lessons a week, Nottebohm calculates the period of instruction
to have been about fifteen months. Inasmuch as among
the exercises in double counterpoint in the tenth there is found
a sketch belonging to the second movement of the Trio, Op.&nbsp;1,
No. 2, which Trio was advertised as finished on May 9th, 1795, it
follows that the study was at or near its end at that date. The
conclusion of his instruction from Albrechtsberger may therefore
be set down at between March and May, 1795.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Instruction From Salieri</span></div>

<p>The third of Beethoven’s teachers in Vienna was the Imperial
Chapelmaster Anton Salieri; but this instruction was neither
systematic nor confined to regular hours. Beethoven took advantage
of Salieri’s willingness “to give gratuitous instruction to
musicians of small means.” He wanted advice in vocal composition,
and submitted to Salieri some settings of Italian songs
which the latter corrected in respect of verbal accent and expression,
rhythm, metrical articulation, subdivision of thought, mood,
singableness, and the conduct of the melody which comprehended
all these things. Having himself taken the initiative in this,
Beethoven devoted himself earnestly and industriously to these
exercises, and they were notably profitable in his creative work.
“Thereafter [also in his German songs] he treated the text with
much greater care than before in respect of its prosodic structure,
as also of its contents and the prescribed situation,” and acquired
a good method of declamation. That Salieri’s influence extended
beyond the period in which Beethoven’s style developed itself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
independently cannot be asserted, since many other and varied
influences made themselves felt later.</p>

<p>This instruction began soon after Beethoven’s arrival in
Vienna and lasted in an unconstrained manner at least until 1802;
at even a later date he asked counsel of Salieri in the composition
of songs, particularly Italian songs. According to an anecdote
related by Czerny, at one of these meetings for instruction Salieri
found fault with a melody as not being appropriate to the air. The
next day he said to Beethoven: “I can’t get your melody out of
my head.” “Then, Herr von Salieri,” replied Beethoven, “it
cannot have been so utterly bad.” The story may be placed in
the early period; but it appears from a statement by Moscheles
that Beethoven still maintained an association with Salieri in
1809. Moscheles, who was in Vienna at this time, found a
note on Salieri’s table which read: “The pupil Beethoven was
here!”</p>

<p>Ries, speaking of the relations between Haydn, Albrechtsberger
and Salieri as teachers and Beethoven as pupil, says: “I
knew them all well; all three valued Beethoven highly, but were
also of one mind touching his habits of study. All of them said
Beethoven was so headstrong and self-sufficient (<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">selbstwollend</i>) that
he had to learn much through harsh experience which he had refused
to accept when it was presented to him as a subject of study.”
Particularly Albrechtsberger and Salieri were of this opinion;
“the dry rules of the former and the comparatively unimportant
ones of the latter concerning dramatic composition (according to
the Italian school of the period) could not appeal to Beethoven.”
It is now known that the “dry rules” of Albrechtsberger could
make a strong appeal to Beethoven as appertaining to theoretical
study, and that the old method of composition to which he remained
true all his life always had a singular charm for him as a
subject of study and investigation.</p>

<p>Here, as in many other cases, the simple statement of the
difficulties suggests their explanation. Beethoven the pupil may
have honestly and conscientiously followed the precepts of his
instructors in whatever he wrote in that character; but Beethoven
the composer stood upon his own territory, followed his own tastes
and impulses, wrote and wrought subject to no other control. He
paid Albrechtsberger to teach him counterpoint&mdash;not to be the
censor and critic of his compositions. And Ries’s memory may
well have deceived him as to the actual scope of the strictures
made by the old master, and have transferred to the pupil what,
fully thirty years before, had been spoken of the composer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span></p>

<p>As has been mentioned, Beethoven’s relations with Salieri
at a later date were still pleasant; the composer dedicated to the
chapelmaster the three violin sonatas, Op.&nbsp;12, which appeared in
1799. Nothing is known of a dedication to Albrechtsberger.
According to an anecdote related by Albrechtsberger’s grandson
Hirsch, Beethoven called him a “musical pedant”; yet we may
see a remnant of gratitude toward his old teacher in Beethoven’s
readiness to take an interest in his young grandson.</p>

<p>We have now to turn our attention to Beethoven’s relations
to Viennese society outside of his study.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Opera and Concerts in Vienna</span></div>

<p>The musical drama naturally took the first place in the musical
life of Vienna at this period. The enthusiasm of Joseph II for
a national German opera, to which the world owed Mozart’s
exquisite “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Entführung</span>,” proved to be but short-lived, and the
Italian <i>opera buffa</i> resumed its old place in his affections. The new
company engaged was, however, equal to the performance of
“Don Giovanni” and “Figaro” and Salieri’s magnificent “Axur.”
Leopold II reached Vienna on the evening of March 13, 1790, to
assume the crown of his deceased brother, but no change was, for
the present, made in the court theatre. Indeed, as late as July
5 he had not entered a theatre, and his first appearance at the opera
was at the performance of “Axur,” September 21, in the company
of his visitor King Ferdinand of Naples; but once firmly settled
on the imperial throne, Joseph’s numerous reforms successfully
annulled, the Turkish war brought to a close and his diverse coronations
happily ended, the Emperor gave his thoughts to the
theatre. Salieri, though now but forty-one years of age, and rich
with the observation and experience of more than twenty years
in the direction of the opera, was, according to Mosel, graciously
allowed, but according to other and better authorities, compelled,
to withdraw from the operatic orchestra and confine himself to
his duties as director of the sacred music in the court chapel and
to the composition of one operatic work annually, if required.
The “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Wiener Zeitung</span>” of January 28, 1792, records the appointment
of Joseph Weigl, Salieri’s pupil and assistant, now twenty-five
years old, “as Chapelmaster and Composer to the Royal
Imperial National Court Theatre with a salary of 1,000 florins.”
The title Composer was rather an empty one. Though already
favorably known to the public, he was forbidden to compose new<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
operas for the court stage. To this end famous masters were to
be invited to Vienna. A first fruit of this new order of things was
the production of Cimarosa’s “<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Il Matrimonio segreto</span>,” February
7, 1792, which with good reason so delighted Leopold that he
gave the performers a supper and ordered them back into the theatre
and heard the opera again <i>da capo</i>. It was among the last of the
Emperor’s theatrical pleasures; he died March 1st, and his wife
on the 15th of May following. Thus for the greater part of the
time from March 1 to May 24, the court theatres were shut; and
yet during the thirteen months ending December 15, 1792, Italian
opera had been given 180 times&mdash;134 times in the Burg and 46
times in the Kärnthnerthor-Theater&mdash;and ballet 163 times; so
that, as no change for the present was made, there was abundance
in these branches of the art for a young composer, like Beethoven,
to hear and see. All accounts agree that the company then performing
was one of uncommon excellence and its performances,
with those of the superb orchestra, proved the value of the long
experience, exquisite taste, unflagging zeal and profound knowledge
of their recent head, Salieri. Such as Beethoven found the
opera in the first week of November, 1792, such it continued for
the next two years&mdash;exclusively Italian, but of the first order.</p>

<p>A single stroke of extraordinary good fortune&mdash;a happy
accident is perhaps a better term&mdash;had just now given such prosperity
to a minor theatrical enterprise that in ten years it was to
erect and occupy the best playhouse in Vienna and, for a time,
to surpass the Court Theatre in the excellence and splendor of its
operatic performances. We mean Schikaneder’s Theater auf der
Wieden; but in 1793 its company was mean, its house small, its
performances bad enough.</p>

<p>Schikaneder’s chapelmaster and composer was John Baptist
Henneberg; the chapelmaster of Marinelli, head of another German
company in the Leopoldstadt, was Wenzel Müller, who
had already begun his long list of 227 light and popular compositions
to texts magical or farcical. Some two weeks after Beethoven’s
arrival in Vienna, on November 23rd, Schikaneder announced,
falsely, the one-hundredth performance of “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Die Zauberflöte</span>,”
an opera the success of which placed his theatre a few years
later upon a totally different footing, and brought Beethoven into
other relations to it than those of an ordinary visitor indulging
his comical taste, <i>teste</i> Seyfried, for listening to and heartily
enjoying very bad music.</p>

<p>The leading dramatic composers of Vienna, not yet named,
must receive a passing notice. Besides Cimarosa, who left Vienna<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
a few months later, Beethoven found Peter Dutillieu, a Frenchman
by birth but an Italian musician by education and profession,
engaged as composer for the Court Theatre. His “Il Trionfo
d’Amore” had been produced there November 14, 1791, and his
“Nanerina e Padolfino” had lately come upon the stage. Ignaz
Umlauf, composer of “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Die schöne Schusterin</span>” and other not unpopular
works, had the title of Chapelmaster and Composer to
the German Court Opera, and was Salieri’s substitute as chapelmaster
in the sacred music of the Court Chapel. Franz Xavier
Süssmayr, so well known from his connection with Mozart, was
just now writing for Schikaneder’s stage; Schenk for Marinelli’s
and for the private stages of the nobility; and Paul Wranitzky,
first violinist and so-called Musikdirektor in the Court Theatre,
author of the then popular “Oberon” composed for the Wieden
stage, was employing his very respectable talents for both Marinelli
and Schikaneder.</p>

<p>The church music of Vienna seems to have been at a very low
point in 1792 and 1793. Two composers, however, whose names
are still of importance in musical history, were then in that city
devoting themselves almost exclusively to this branch of the art;
Albrechtsberger, Court Organist, but in a few months (through
the death of Leopold Hoffmann, March 17, 1793) to become
musical director at St. Stephen’s; and Joseph Eybler (some five
years older than Beethoven), who had just become <i>Regens chori</i>
in the Carmelite church, whence he was called to a similar and
better position in the Schottische Kirche two years later.</p>

<p>Public concerts, as the term is now understood, may be said
not to have existed, and regular subscription concerts were few.
Mozart gave a few series of them, but after his death there appears
to have been no one of sufficient note in the musical world to
make such a speculation remunerative. Single subscription concerts
given by virtuosos, and annual ones by some of the leading
resident musicians, of course, took place then as before and since.
The only real and regular concerts were the four annual performances
in the Burgtheater, two at Christmas and two at Easter,
for the benefit of the musicians’ widows and orphans. These
concerts, established mainly by Gassmann and Salieri, were never
exclusive in their programmes&mdash;oratorio, symphony, cantata, concerto,
whatever would add to their attraction, found place. The
stage was covered with the best musicians and vocalists of the
capital and the superb orchestra was equally ready to accompany
the playing of a Mozart or of an ephemeral <i>Wunderkind</i>. Risbeck
was told ten years before that the number taking part in orchestra<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
and chorus had even then on some occasions reached 400&mdash;a statement,
however, which looks much like exaggeration.</p>

<p>Very uncommon semi-private concerts were still kept up in
1793. The reader of Mozart’s biography will remember that in
1782 this great composer joined a certain Martin in giving a series
of concerts during the morning hours in the Augarten Hall, most
of the performers being dilettanti and the music being furnished
from the library of von Kees. These concerts found such favor
that they were renewed for several years and generally were twelve
in number.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Ladies of even the highest nobility permitted themselves to be heard.
The auditorium was extremely brilliant and everything was conducted in
so orderly and decent a fashion that everybody was glad to support the
institute to the best of his energies. The receipts from the chief subscription
were expended entirely on the cost of the concerts. Later
Herr Rudolph assumed the direction. (“Allg. Mus. Zeitung,” III, 45.)</p></div>

<p>This man, still young, and a fine violin-player, was the director
when Beethoven came to Vienna, and the extraordinary spectacle
was still to be seen of princes and nobles following his lead in the
performance of orchestral music to an audience of their own class
at the strange hours of from 6 to 8 in the morning!</p>

<p>From the above it appears that Vienna presented to the
young musician no preëminent advantages either in opera, church-music
or its public concerts. Other cities equalled the Austrian
capital in the first two, and London was then far in advance of all
in the number, variety and magnificence of the last. It was in
another field that Vienna surpassed every competitor. As Gluck
twenty years before had begun the great revolution in operatic
music completed by Mozart, so Haydn, building on the foundation
of the Bachs and aided by Mozart, was effecting a new development
of purely instrumental music which was yet to reach
its highest stage through the genius and daring of the youth now
his pupil. The example set by the Austrian family through so
many generations had produced its natural effect, and a knowledge
of and taste for music were universal among the princes and
nobles of the empire. Some of the more wealthy princes, like
Esterhazy, maintained musical establishments complete even to
the Italian opera; others were contented with hearing the mass
sung in their house-chapel to an orchestral accompaniment; where
this was impossible, a small orchestra only was kept up, often composed
of the officials and servants, who were selected with regard
to their musical abilities; and so down to the band of wind-instruments,
the string quartet, and even to a single organ-player,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
pianist or violinist. What has been said in a former chapter of
music as a quasi-necessity at the courts of the ecclesiastical princes,
applies in great measure to the secular nobility. At their castles
and country-seats in the summer, amusement was to be provided
for many an otherwise tedious hour; and in their city residences
during the winter they and their guests could not always feast,
dance or play at cards; and here, too, music became a common and
favored recreation. At all events, it was the fashion. Outside
the ranks of the noble-born, such as by talents, high culture or
wealth occupied high social positions, followed the example and
opened their salons to musicians and lovers of music, moved thereto
for the most part by a real, rarely by a pretended, taste for the
art&mdash;in either case aiding and encouraging its progress. Hence, an
enormous demand for chamber music, both vocal and instrumental,
especially the latter. The demand created the supply by encouraging
genius and talent to labor in that direction; and thus the
Austrian school of instrumental music soon led the world, as in the
previous generation the demand for oratorios in England gave that
country the supremacy in that branch of art.</p>

<p>During certain months of the year, Vienna was filled with the
greatest nobles, not only of the Austrian states, but of other portions
of the German Empire. Those who spent their time mostly
in their own small courts came up to the capital but for a short
season; others reversed this, making the city their usual residence
and visiting their estates only in summer. By the former class
many a once (if not still) famous composer in their service was thus
occasionally for short periods brought to the metropolis&mdash;as
Mozart by the brutal Archbishop of Salzburg, and Haydn by
Prince Esterhazy. By the latter class many of the distinguished
composers and virtuosos resident in the city were taken into the
country during the summer to be treated as equals, to live like
gentlemen among gentlemen. Another mode of encouraging the
art was the ordering or purchasing of compositions; and this not
only from composers of established reputation, as Haydn, Mozart,
C. P. E. Bach, but also from young and as yet unknown men; thus
affording a twofold benefit&mdash;pecuniary aid and an opportunity of
exhibiting their powers.</p>

<p>The instrumental virtuosos, when not permanently engaged
in the service of some prince or theatre, looked in the main for the
reward of their studies and labors to the private concerts of the
nobility. If at the same time they were composers, it was in such
concerts that they brought their productions to a hearing. The
reader of Jahn’s biography of Mozart will remember how much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
even he depended upon this resource to gain the means of support
for himself and family. Out of London, even so late as 1793, there
can hardly be said to have existed a “musical public,” as the term
is now understood, and in Vienna at least, with its 200,000 inhabitants,
a virtuoso rarely ventured to announce a concert to which
he had not already a subscription, sufficient to ensure him against
loss, from those at whose residences he had successfully exhibited
his skill. Beethoven, remaining “in Vienna without salary until
recalled” by Max, found in these resources and his pupils an ample
income.</p>

<p>But this topic requires something more than the above general
remarks. Some twelve years previous to Beethoven’s coming
to Vienna, Risbeck, speaking of the art in that capital, had written:</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Orchestras of the Great Nobles</span></div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Musicians are the only ones (artists) concerning whom the nobility
exhibit taste. Many houses maintain private bands for their own delectation,
and all the public concerts prove that this field of art stands in
high respect. It is possible to enlist four or five large orchestras here,
all of them incomparable. The number of real virtuosos is small, but
as regards the orchestral musicians scarcely anything more beautiful
is to be heard in the world.</p></div>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Titled Music-Lovers in Vienna</span></div>

<p>How many such orchestras were still kept up in 1792-’93 it
is, probably, now impossible to determine. Those of Princes Lobkowitz,
Schwarzenberg and Auersperg may safely be named.
Count Heinrich von Haugwitz and doubtless Count Batthyany
brought their musicians with them when they came to the capital
for “the season.” The Esterhazy band, dismissed after the death
of Haydn’s old master, seems not yet to have been renewed. Prince
Grassalkowitz (or Kracsalkowitz) had reduced his to a band of
eight wind-instruments&mdash;oboes, clarinets, bassoons, horns&mdash;a kind
of organization then much in vogue. Baron Braun had one to
play at dinner as at the supper in “Don Giovanni”&mdash;an accessory
to the scene which Mozart introduced out of his own frequent
experience. Prince Karl Lichnowsky and others retained their
own players of string quartets.</p>

<p>The grandees of the Bohemian and Moravian capitals&mdash;Kinsky,
Clamm, Nostiz, Thun, Buquoi, Hartig, Salm-Pachta,
Sporck, Fünfkirchen, etc.&mdash;emulated the Austrian and Hungarian
nobles. As many of them had palaces also in Vienna, and most,
if not all, spent part of the year there, bringing with them a few
of the more skilful members of their orchestras to execute chamber
music and for the nucleus of a band when symphonies, concertos
and grand vocal works were to be executed, they also added
their contingent to the musical as well as to the political and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
fashionable life of the metropolis. The astonishingly fruitful last
eight years of Mozart’s life falling within the period now under
contemplation, contributed to musical literature compositions wonderfully
manifold in character and setting an example that forced
other composers to leave the beaten track. Haydn had just returned
from his first stay in London, enriched with the pregnant
experience acquired during that visit. Van Swieten had gained
during his residence in Berlin appreciation of and love for the works
of Handel, Bach and their schools, and since his return to Vienna,
about 1778, had exerted, and was still exerting, a very powerful
and marked influence upon Vienna’s musical taste.</p>

<p>Thus all the conditions precedent for the elevation of the art
were just at this time fulfilled at Vienna, and in one department&mdash;that
of instrumental music&mdash;they existed in a degree unknown in
any other city. The extraordinary results as to the quantity produced
in those years may be judged from the sale-catalogue (1779)
of a single music-dealer, Johann Traeg, which gives of symphonies,
symphonies-concertantes and overtures (the last being in a small
minority) the extraordinary number of 512. The music produced
at private concerts given by the nobility ranged from the grand
oratorios, operas, symphonies, down to variations for the pianoforte
and to simple songs. Leading musicians and composers, whose
circumstances admitted of it, also gave private concerts at which
they made themselves and their works known, and to which their
colleagues were invited. Prince Lobkowitz, at the time Beethoven
reached Vienna, was a young man of twenty years. He was
born on December 7, 1772, and had just married, on August 2,
a daughter of Prince Schwarzenberg. He was a violinist of considerable
powers and so devoted a lover of music and the drama,
so profuse a squanderer of his income upon them, as in twenty
years to reduce himself to bankruptcy. Precisely Beethoven’s
supposed age, the aristocrat of wealth and power and the aristocrat
of talent and genius became exceedingly intimate, occasionally
quarrelling and making up their differences as if belonging by birth
to the same sphere.</p>

<p>The reigning Prince Esterhazy was that Paul Anton who,
after the death of his father on February 25, 1790, broke up the
musical establishment at Esterhaz and gave Haydn relief from his
thirty years of service. He died on January 22, 1794, and was
succeeded by his son Nicholas, a young man just five years older
than Beethoven. Prince Nicholas inherited his grandfather’s
taste for music, reëngaged an orchestra, and soon became known
as one of the most zealous promoters of Roman Catholic church-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>music.
The best composers of Vienna, including Beethoven,
wrote masses for the chapel at Esterhaz, where they were performed
with great splendor.</p>

<p>Count Johann Nepomuk Esterhazy, “of the middle line zu
Frakno,” was a man of forty-five years, a good performer upon the
oboe, and (which is much to his credit) had been a firm friend and
patron of Mozart.</p>

<p>Of Count Franz Esterhazy, a man of thirty-five years, Schönfeld,
in his “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Jahrbuch der Tonkunst</span>,” thus speaks: “This great
friend of music at certain times of the year gives large and splendid
concerts at which, for the greater part, large and elevated compositions
are performed&mdash;particularly the choruses of Handel, the
‘Sanctus’ of Emanuel Bach, the ‘Stabat Mater’ of Pergolese, and
the like. At these concerts there are always a number of the best
virtuosos.”</p>

<p>It was not the present Prince Joseph Kinsky (who died in
1798 in his forty-eighth year) who at a later period became a distinguished
patron of Beethoven, but his son Ferdinand Johann
Nepomuk, then a bright boy of eleven years, born on December
4, 1781, upon whose youthful taste the strength, beauty and
novelty of that composer’s works made a deep impression. Prince
Carl Lichnowsky, the pupil and friend of Mozart, had a quartet
concert at his dwelling every Friday morning. The regularly
engaged musicians were Ignaz Schuppanzigh, son of a professor
in the Real-Schule, and a youth at this time of sixteen years (if
the musical lexica are to be trusted), first violin; Louis Sina, pupil
of Förster, also a very young man, second violin; Franz Weiss,
who completed his fifteenth year on January 18, 1793, viola; and
Anton Kraft, or his son Nicholas, a boy of fourteen years (born
December 18, 1778), violoncello. It was, in fact, a quartet of
boy virtuosos, of whom Beethoven, several years older, could make
what he would.</p>

<p>The Prince’s wife was Marie Christine, twenty years of age,
one of those “Three Graces,” as Georg Förster called them,
daughters of that Countess Thun in whose house Mozart had found
such warm friendship and appreciation, and whose noble qualities
are so celebrated by Burney, Reichardt and Förster. The Princess,
as well as her husband, belonged to the better class of amateur
performers upon the pianoforte.</p>

<p>Court Councillor von Kees, Vice-President of the Court of
Appeals of Lower Austria, was still living. He was, says Gyrowetz,
speaking of a period a few years earlier, “recognized as the foremost
music-lover and dilettante in Vienna; and twice a week he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
gave in his house society concerts at which were gathered together
the foremost virtuosos of Vienna, and the first composers, such as
Joseph Haydn, Mozart, Dittersdorf, Hoffmeister, Albrechtsberger,
Giarnovichi and so on. Haydn’s symphonies were played there.”
In Haydn’s letters to Madame Genzinger the name of von Kees
often occurs&mdash;the last time in a note of August 4, 1792, which
mentions that the writer is that day to dine with the Court Councillor.
This distinguished man left on his death (January 5, 1795)
a very extensive collection of music.</p>

<p>Gottfried, Freiherr van Swieten, son of Maria Theresia’s
famous Dutch physician, says Schönfeld, is,</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Van Swieten and His Influence</span></div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>as it were, looked upon as a patriarch of music. He has taste only for
the great and exalted. He himself many years ago composed twelve
beautiful symphonies (“stiff as himself,” said Haydn). When he attends
a concert our semi-connoisseurs never take their eyes off him, seeking to
read in his features, not always intelligible to every one, what ought to be
their opinion of the music. Every year he gives a few large and brilliant
concerts at which only music by the old masters is performed. His preference
is for the Handelian manner, and he generally has some of Handel’s
great choruses performed. As late as last Christmas (1794) he gave such
a concert at Prince von Paar’s, at which an oratorio by this master was
performed.</p></div>

<p>Neukomm told Prof. Jahn that in concerts, “if it chanced that
a whispered conversation began, His Excellency, who was in the
habit of sitting in the first row of seats, would rise solemnly, draw
himself up to his full height, turn to the culprits, fix a long and
solemn gaze upon them, and slowly resume his chair. It was
effective, always.” He had some peculiar notions of composition;
he was, for instance, fond of imitations of natural sounds in music
and forced upon Haydn the imitation of frogs in “The Seasons.”
Haydn himself says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>This entire passage in imitation of a frog did not flow from my
pen. I was constrained to write down the French croak. At an orchestral
performance this wretched conceit soon disappears, but it cannot
be justified in a pianoforte score. Let the critics be not too severe on
me. I am an old man and cannot revise all this again.</p></div>

<p>But to van Swieten, surely, is due the credit of having founded
in Vienna a taste for Handel’s oratorios and Bach’s organ and
pianoforte music, thus adding a new element to the music there.
The costs of the oratorio performances were not, however, defrayed
by him, as Schönfeld seems to intimate. They were met by the
association called by him into being, and of which he was perpetual
secretary, whose members were the Princes Liechtenstein,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
Esterhazy, Schwarzenberg, Auersperg, Kinsky, Trautmannsdorf,
Sinsendorf, and the Counts Czernin, Harrach, Erdödy and Fries;
at whose palaces as well as in van Swieten’s house and sometimes
in the great hall of the Imperial Royal Library the performances
were given at midday to an audience of invited guests. Fräulein
Martinez, who holds so distinguished a place in Burney’s account
of his visit to Vienna&mdash;that pupil of Porpora at whose music-lessons
the young Joseph Haydn forty years before had been employed
as accompanist&mdash;still flourished in the Michael’s House and gave
a musical party every Saturday evening during the season.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Court Councillor and Chamber Paymaster von Meyer (says Schönfeld)
is so excellent a lover of music that his entire personnel in the chancellary
is musical, among them being such artists as a Raphael and a
Hauschka. It will readily be understood, therefore, that here in the
city as well as at his country-seat there are many concerts. His Majesty
the Emperor himself has attended some of these concerts.</p></div>

<p>These details are sufficient to illustrate and confirm the remarks
made above upon Vienna as the central point of instrumental
music. Of the great number of composers in that branch
of the art whom Beethoven found there, a few of the more eminent
must be named.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Famous Composers in Vienna</span></div>

<p>Of course, Haydn stood at the head. The next in rank&mdash;<i>longo
intervallo</i>&mdash;was Mozart’s successor in the office of Imperial
Chamber Composer, Leopold Kozeluch, a Bohemian, now just
forty years of age. Though now forgotten and, according to
Beethoven, “miserabilis,” he was renowned throughout Europe for
his quartets and other chamber music. A man of less popular
repute but of a solid genius and acquirements far beyond those of
Kozeluch, whom Beethoven greatly respected and twenty-five
years later called his “old master,” was Emanuel Aloys Förster, a
Silesian, now forty-five years of age. His quintets, quartets and
the like ranked very high, but at that time were known for the
most part only in manuscript. Anton Eberl, five years the senior
of Beethoven, a Viennese by birth, had composed two operettas
in the sixteenth year of his age which were produced at the Kärnthnerthor-Theater,
one of which gained the young author the favor
of Gluck. He seems to have been a favorite of Mozart and
caught so much of the spirit and style of that master as to produce
compositions which were printed by dishonest publishers under
Mozart’s name, and as his were sold throughout Europe. In 1776
he accompanied the Widow Mozart and her sister, Madame Lange,
the vocalist, in the tour through Germany, gaining that reputation
in other cities which he enjoyed at home, both as pianist and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
composer. His force was in instrumental composition, and we
shall hereafter see him for a moment as a symphonist bearing
away the palm from Beethoven!</p>

<p>Johann Vanhall, whose name was so well known in Paris and
London that Burney, twenty years before, sought him out in his
garret in a suburb of Vienna, was as indefatigable as ever in production.
Gerber says in his first Lexicon (1792) that Breitkopf
and Härtel had then fifty of his symphonies in manuscript. His
fecundity was equal to that of Haydn; his genius such that all his
works are now forgotten. It is needless to continue this list.</p>

<p>One other fact illustrating the musical tastes and accomplishments
of the higher classes of the capital may be added. There
were, during the winter 1792-93, ten private theatres with amateur
companies in activity, of which the more important were in the
residences of the nobles Stockhammer, Kinsky, Sinsendorf and
Strassaldo, and of the bookseller Schrambl. Most of these companies
produced operas and operettas.</p>

<p>However quiet and “without observation” Beethoven’s
advent in Vienna may have been at that time when men’s
minds were occupied by movements of armies and ideas of
revolution, he could hardly have gone thither under better auspices.
He was Court Organist and Pianist to the Emperor’s uncle; his
talents in that field were well known to the many Austrians of rank
who had heard him in Bonn when visiting there or when paying
their respects to the Elector in passing to and from the Austrian
Netherlands; he was a pupil of Joseph Haydn&mdash;a circumstance in
itself sufficient to secure him a hearing; and he was protected by
Count Waldstein, whose family connections were such that he could
introduce his favorite into the highest circles, the imperial house
only excepted. Waldstein’s mother was a Liechtenstein; his grandmother
a Trautmannsdorf; three of his sisters had married respectively
into the families Dietrichstein, Crugenburg and Wallis;
and by the marriages of uncles and aunts he was connected
with the great houses Oettingen-Spielberg, Khevenhüller-Melisch,
Kinsky, Palfy von Erdöd and Ulfeld&mdash;not to mention others less
known. If the circle be extended by a degree or two it embraces
the names Kaunitz, Lobkowitz, Kohary, Fünfkirchen, Keglevics
and Colloredo-Mansfeld.</p>

<p>Dr. Burney, in closing his “Present State of Music in Germany,”
notes the distinction in the styles of composition and performance
in some of the principal cities of that country, “Vienna
being most remarkable for fire and animation; Mannheim for
neat and brilliant execution; Berlin for counterpoint and Brunswick
for taste.” Since Burney’s tour (1772) Vienna had the
highest example of all these qualities united in Mozart. But he
had passed away, and no great pianist of the first rank remained;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
there were extraordinary dilettanti and professional pianists “of
very neat and brilliant execution,” but none who possessed great
“fire, animation and invention,” qualities still most valued in
Vienna and in which the young Beethoven, with all the hardness
and heaviness of manipulation caused by his devotion to the organ,
was wholly unrivalled. With all the salons in the metropolis open
to him, his success as a virtuoso was, therefore, certain. All the
contemporary authorities, and all the traditions of those years,
agree in the fact of that success, and that his playing of Bach’s
preludes and fugues especially, his reading of the most difficult
scores at sight and his extemporaneous performances excited ever
new wonder and delight. Schindler records that van Swieten,
after musical performances at his house, “detained Beethoven and
persuaded him to add a few fugues by Sebastian Bach as an evening
blessing,” and he preserves a note without date, though evidently
belonging to Beethoven’s first years in Vienna, which proves how
high a place the young man had then won in the old gentleman’s
favor:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>To Mr. Beethoven in Alstergasse, No. 45, with the Prince Lichnowsky:
If there is nothing to hinder next Wednesday I should be glad to
see you at my home at half past 8 with your nightcap in your bag. Give
me an immediate answer.</p>

<p class="sig">
Swieten.</p></div>

<p>There is also an entry in the oft-cited memorandum book
belonging in date to October or November, 1793, which may be
given in this connection: “Supped in the evening at Swieten’s,
17 pourboire. To the janitor 4 x for opening the door.”</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">The Three Trios, Op.&nbsp;1</span></div>

<p>But the instant and striking success of Beethoven as virtuoso
by no means filled up the measure of his ambition. He aspired
to the higher position of composer, and to obtain this more was
needed than the performance of variations, however excellent. To
this end he selected the three Trios afterwards published as Op.&nbsp;1,
and brought them to performance at the house of Prince
Lichnowsky. Happily for us, Beethoven related some particulars
concerning this first performance of these compositions in Vienna
to his pupil Ries, who gives the substance of the story thus:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>It was planned to introduce the first three Trios of Beethoven, which
were about to be published as Op.&nbsp;1, to the artistic world at a soirée at
prince Lichnowsky’s. Most of the artists and music-lovers were invited,
especially Haydn, for whose opinion all were eager. The Trios were
played and at once commanded extraordinary attention. Haydn also
said many pretty things about them, but advised Beethoven not to publish
the third, in C minor. This astonished Beethoven, inasmuch as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
he considered the third the best of the Trios, as it is still the one which
gives the greatest pleasure and makes the greatest effect. Consequently,
Haydn’s remark left a bad impression on Beethoven and led him to
think that Haydn was envious, jealous and ill-disposed toward him. I
confess that when Beethoven told me of this I gave it little credence. I
therefore took occasion to ask Haydn himself about it. His answer,
however, confirmed Beethoven’s statement; he said he had not believed
that this Trio would so quickly and easily be understood and so favorably
received by the public.</p></div>

<p>The Fischoff manuscript says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The three Trios for pianoforte, violin and violoncello, Op.&nbsp;1 (the
pearls of all sonatas), which are in fact his sixth work, justly excited admiration,
though they were performed in only a few circles. Wherever this
was done, however, connoisseurs and music-lovers bestowed upon them
undivided applause, which grew with the succeeding works as the hearers
not only accustomed themselves to the striking and original qualities
of the master but grasped his spirit and strove for the high privilege of
understanding him.</p></div>

<p>More than two years passed by, however, before the composer
thought fit to send these Trios to the press; perhaps restrained
by a feeling of modesty, since he was still a student, perhaps by a
doubt as to the success of compositions so new in style, or by prudence,
choosing to delay their publication until they had been so
often performed from the manuscript as to secure their comprehension
and appreciation, and thus an adequate number of subscribers.
In the meantime he prepared the way for them by
publishing a few sets of variations. “Beethoven had composed
variations on themes from Mozart’s ‘<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Zauberflöte</span>,’ which he had
already sketched in Bonn, and Zmeskall took it upon himself to
submit them to a publisher; but they had only a small sale.”
(The Fischoff MS.) This refers doubtless to the Variations “Se
vuol ballare” from “Le Nozze di Figaro,” which, having been revised
and improved by a new coda, came out in July, 1793, with
a dedication to Eleonore von Breuning. It was not until the next
year that the thirteen variations upon the theme “Es war einmal
ein alter Mann,” from Dittersdorf’s “Rothkäppchen,” appeared,
and these were followed by those for four hands on the Waldstein
theme, first advertised in January, 1795.</p>

<p>In fact, Beethoven evidently was in no haste to publish his
compositions. It will presently be seen that he sent the “Se vuol
ballare” variations to press partly at the request of others and
partly to entrap the rival pianists of Vienna. A few years later
we shall find him dashing off and immediately publishing variations
on popular theatrical melodies; but works of greater scope,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
and especially his pianoforte concertos, were for the most part
long retained in his exclusive possession. Thus the Pianoforte
Concerto in B-flat major, Op.&nbsp;18, though supposed by Tomaschek
to have been composed at Prague in 1798, certainly (if Beethoven’s
own words in a letter to Breitkopf and Härtel are to be believed)
preceded in composition that in C major, Op.&nbsp;15, and must, therefore,
have been finished at the latest in March, 1795, and was doubtless
often played by him at private concerts during the period now
before us. It was not published until 1801.</p>

<p>Let the reader now recall to mind some of the points previously
dwelt upon: the Fischenich letter of January and Neefe’s
letter of October, 1793, which record the favorable reports sent
to Bonn of Beethoven’s musical progress; his studies with Haydn
and Schenk; the cares and perplexities caused him temporarily
by the death of his father, and the unpleasant circumstances
attending that event; his steady success as a virtuoso; his visit
in the summer to Prince Esterhazy; and it is obvious with what
industry and energy he engaged in his new career, with what zeal
and unfaltering activity he labored to make the most of his
opportunities. In one year after leaving Bonn he felt his success
secure, and no longer feared Hamlet’s “slings and arrows of outrageous
fortune.” This is indicated in a passage (“O, how we
shall then rejoice together,” etc.) of the earliest of his Vienna letters
which has been preserved&mdash;that letter in which, as Wegeler remarks,
“he asked pardon for much more error than he had committed,”
and which, though often reprinted from the “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Notizen</span>,”
is too important and characteristic to be here omitted.</p>

<p class="salut">Most estimable Leonore!<br />
My most precious friend!
</p>

<p>Not until I have lived almost a year in the capital do you
receive a letter from me, and yet you were most assuredly perpetually
in my liveliest memory. Often in thought I have conversed with you
and your dear family, though not with that peace of mind which I could
have desired. It was then that the wretched misunderstanding hovered
before me and my conduct presented itself as most despicable. But it
was too late. O, what would I not give could I obliterate from my life
those actions so degrading to myself and so contrary to my character.
True, there were many circumstances which tended to estrange us, and I
suspect that tales whispered in our ears of remarks made one about the
other were chiefly that which prevented us from coming to an understanding.
We both believed that we were speaking from conviction;
whereas it was only in anger, and we were both deceived. Your good
and noble character, my dear friend, is sufficient assurance to me that
you forgave me long ago. But we are told that the sincerest contrition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
consists in acknowledgment of our faults; and to do this has been my
desire. And now let us drop the curtain on the affair, only drawing
from it this lesson&mdash;that when friends quarrel it is much better to have
it out face to face than to turn to a go-between.</p>

<p>With this you will receive a dedication from me to you concerning
which I only wish that the work were a larger one and more worthy of
you. I was plagued here to publish the little work, and I took advantage
of the opportunity, my estimable E., to show my respect and friendship
for you and my enduring memory of your family. Take this trifle and
remember that it comes from a friend who respects you greatly. Oh,
if it but gives you pleasure, my wishes will be completely fulfilled. Let
it be a reminder of the time when I spent so many and such blessed hours
at your home. Perhaps it will keep me in your recollection until I
eventually return to you, which, it is true, is not likely to be soon. But
how we shall rejoice then, my dear friend&mdash;you will then find in your
friend a happier man, from whose visage time and a kindlier fate shall
have smoothed out all the furrows of a hateful past.</p>

<p>If you should chance to see B. Koch, please say to her that it is
not nice of her never once to have written to me. I wrote to her twice
and three times to Malchus, but no answer. Say to her that if she doesn’t
want to write she might at least urge Malchus to do so. In conclusion
I venture a request; it is this: I should like once again to be so happy
as to own a waistcoat knit of hare’s wool by your hands, my dear friend.
Pardon the immodest request, my dear friend, but it proceeds from a
great predilection for everything that comes from your hands. Privately
I may also acknowledge that a little vanity is also involved in the request;
I want to be able to say that I have something that was given
me by the best and most estimable girl in Bonn. I still have the
waistcoat which you were good enough to give me in Bonn, but it has
grown so out of fashion that I can only treasure it in my wardrobe as
something very precious because it came from you. You would give
me much pleasure if you were soon to rejoice me with a dear letter from
yourself. If my letters should in any way please you I promise in this
to be at your command so far as lies in my power, as everything is welcome
to me which enables me to show how truly I am</p>

<p class="sig">
Your admiring,<br />
true friend<br />
L. v. Beethoven.
</p>

<p>P.S. The V. [variations] you will find a little difficult to play,
especially the trills in the <i>coda</i>; but don’t let that alarm you. It is
so contrived that you need play only the trill, leaving out the other
notes because they are also in the violin part. I never would have composed
a thing of the kind had I not often observed that here and there in
Vienna there was somebody who, after I had improvised of an evening,
noted down many of my peculiarities, and made parade of them next day
as his own. Foreseeing that some of these things would soon appear in
print, I resolved to anticipate them. Another reason that I had was to
embarrass the local pianoforte masters. Many of them are my deadly
enemies and I wanted to revenge myself on them, knowing that once
in a while somebody would ask them to play the variations and they
would make a sorry show with them.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span></p>

<p>Except Beethoven’s memorandum, “Schuppanzigh 3 times
each W.; Albrechtsberger 3 times each W.”, which indicates his
change of instructors, there is nothing to be recorded until, probably
in May or June (1794), we come to the fragment of another
letter to Eleonore von Breuning also contained in Wegeler’s
“<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Notizen</span>” (p. 60), which has particular interest both as showing
how bitterly his conscience reproached him for acts inconsistent
with the forbearance and command of temper due to friendship,
but in which he ever remained too apt to indulge, and as adding
some implied confirmation of the argument previously made in
relation to the compositions of the Bonn period. In this letter
he acknowledges receipt of a cravat embroidered by Eleonore and
protests that thoughts of her generosity and his unworthiness had
brought him to tears. He continues: “Do pray believe me that
little as I have deserved it, <i>my friend</i> (let me always call you such),
I have suffered much and still suffer from the loss of your friendship....
As a slight return for your kind recollection of me
I take the liberty of sending these Variations and the Rondo with
violin (accompaniment). I have a great deal to do or I should
have transcribed the Sonata I promised you long ago. It is a
mere sketch in manuscript, and to copy it would be a difficult,
etc.” The letter is signed: “The friend who still reveres you,
Beethowen” (<i>sic</i>).<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a></p>

<p>In January, 1794, Elector Max had paid a short visit to Vienna,
where, perhaps, it was determined that Beethoven should remain
“without salary until recalled.” After the declaration of war
by the Empire against France, the electorate, as a German state,
could no longer remain neutral; and thus it came to pass that in
October the victorious French army marched into Bonn. The
Elector fled to Frankfort-on-the-Main, November 6th, thence to
Münster, while his court and all such as were obnoxious to the
republican authorities dispersed in all directions for safety.</p>

<p>One of these fugitives, a young man of twenty-nine years
but already the Rector of the University, to “save his head”
hastened away to Vienna&mdash;Dr. Wegeler. He reached that capital<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
in October and found Beethoven not in the “room on the ground
floor” where “it was not necessary to pay the housekeeper more
than 7 florins,” but living as a guest in the family of Prince Karl
Lichnowsky; and this explains sufficiently the cessation of those
records of monthly payments before noticed.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Dr. Wegeler’s Reminiscences</span></div>

<p>The reminiscences of Wegeler for the period of his stay in
Vienna, excepting those which may be better introduced chronologically
in other connections, may well find place here. They are
interesting and characteristic in themselves and indicate, also,
the great change for the better in Beethoven’s pecuniary condition;
for a man who keeps a servant and a horse cannot, if honest, be
a sufferer from poverty:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Carl, Prince of Lichnowsky, Count Werdenberg, Dynast Granson,
was a very great patron, yes, a friend of Beethoven’s, who took him
into his house as a guest, where he remained at least a few years. I
found him there toward the end of the year 1794, and left him there in
the middle of 1796. Meanwhile, however, Beethoven had almost always
a home in the country.</p>

<p>The Prince was a great lover and connoisseur of music. He played
the pianoforte, and by studying Beethoven’s pieces and playing them
more or less well, sought to convince him that there was no need of
changing anything in his style of composition, though the composer’s
attention was often called to the difficulties of his works. There were
performances at his house every Friday morning, participated in by
four hired musicians&mdash;Schuppanzigh, Weiss, Kraft and another (Link?),
besides our friend; generally also an amateur, Zmeskall. Beethoven
always listened with pleasure to the observations of these gentlemen.
Thus, to cite a single instance, the famous violoncellist Kraft in my presence
called his attention to a passage in the finale of the Trio, Op.&nbsp;1,
No. 3, to the fact that it ought to be marked “sulla corda G,” and the
indication 4-4 time which Beethoven had marked in the finale of the
second Trio, changed to 2-4. Here the new compositions of Beethoven,
so far as was feasible, were first performed. Here there were generally
present several great musicians and music-lovers. I, too, as long as I
lived in Vienna, was present, if not every time, at least most of the time.</p>

<p>Here a Hungarian count once placed a difficult composition by Bach
in manuscript before him which he played <i>a vista</i> exactly as Bach would
have played it, according to the testimony of the owner. Here the
Viennese author Förster once brought him a quartet of which he had
made a clean copy only that morning. In the second portion of the
first movement the violoncello got out. Beethoven stood up, and still
playing his own part sang the bass accompaniment. When I spoke
about it to him as a proof of extraordinary acquirements, he replied
with a smile: “The bass part <i>had</i> to be so, else the author would have
known nothing about composition.” To the remark that he had played
a <i>presto</i> which he had never seen before so rapidly that it must have been
impossible to see the individual notes, he answered: “Nor is that necessary;
if you read rapidly there may be a multitude of typographical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
errors, but you neither see nor give heed to them, so long as the language
is a familiar one.”</p>

<p>After the concert the musicians generally stayed to dine. Here
there gathered, in addition, artists and savants without regard to social
position. The Princess Christiane was the highly cultivated daughter
of Count Franz Joseph von Thun, who, a very philanthropic and respectable
gentleman, was disposed to extravagant enthusiasm by his intercourse
with Lavater, and believed himself capable of healing diseases
through the power of his right hand.</p></div>

<p>The following undated letter also belongs to the years of
Beethoven’s intimate association with Wegeler in Vienna (1794-96).
It is significant of Beethoven’s character. Though easily offended
and prone to anger, no sooner was the first ebullition of temper
past than he was so reconciliatory and open to explanation that
usually his contrition was out of all proportion to his fault. For
this reason, and because it presents the friend in a light which provoked
a protest from his modesty, Wegeler was unwilling to make
public the entire letter.<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Confession, Contrition, Petition</span></div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Dearest! Best! In what an odious light you have exhibited me to
myself! I acknowledge it, I do not deserve your friendship. You are
so noble, so considerate, and the first time that I ranged myself alongside
of you I fell so far below you! Ah, for weeks I have displeased
my best and noblest friend! You think that I have lost some of my
goodness of heart, but, thank Heaven! it was no intentional or deliberate
malice which induced me to act as I did towards you; it was my inexcusable
thoughtlessness which did not permit me to see the matter in
its true light. O, how ashamed I am, not only for your sake but also
my own. I can scarcely trust myself to ask for your friendship again.
Oh, Wegeler, my only comfort lies in this, that you have known me almost
from my childhood, and yet, O let me say for myself, I was always good,
and always strove to be upright and true in my actions&mdash;otherwise how
could you have loved me? Could I have changed so fearfully for the
worse in such a short time? Impossible; these feelings of goodness and
love of righteousness cannot have died forever in me in a moment. No,
Wegeler, dearest, best, O, venture again to throw yourself entirely into
the arms of your B.; trust in the good qualities you used to find in him;
I will guarantee that the pure temple of sacred friendship which you
erect shall remain firm forever; no accident, no storm shall ever shake
its foundations&mdash;firm&mdash;forever&mdash;our friendship&mdash;pardon&mdash;oblivion&mdash;a
new upflaming of the dying, sinking friendship&mdash;O, Wegeler, do not
reject this hand of reconciliation. Place yours in mine&mdash;O, God!&mdash;but
no more; I am coming to throw myself in your arms, to entreat you
to restore to me my lost friend. And you will give yourself to me,
your penitent, loving, never-forgetting</p>

<p class="sig">
Beethoven again.
</p>

<p>It was only now that I received your letter, because I have just
returned home.</p></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>
<p>In this connection Wegeler comes to speak of the outward
conditions of Beethoven: “Beethoven,” he says on page 33,</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>brought up under extremely restricted circumstances, and as it were,
under guardianship, though that of his friends, did not know the
value of money and was anything but economical. Thus, to cite a
single instance, the Prince’s dinner hour was fixed at 4 o’clock. “Now,”
said Beethoven, “it is desired that every day I shall be at home at half-past
3, put on better clothes, care for my beard, etc.&mdash;I can’t stand that!”
So it happened that he frequently went to the taverns, since, as has been
said, in this as in all other matters of economy, he knew nothing about
the value of things or of money. The Prince, Wegeler continues, who
had a loud, metallic voice, once directed his serving-man that if ever
he and Beethoven should ring at the same time the latter was to be first
served. Beethoven heard this, and the same day engaged a servant for
himself. In the same manner, once when he took a whim to learn to
ride, which speedily left him, the stable of the Prince being offered him,
he bought a horse.</p></div>

<p>Concerning his friend’s affairs of the heart, Wegeler had opportunity
to make observations in Vienna. He relates on page 43
that while he was in the capital Beethoven “was always in love
and made many conquests which would have been difficult if not
impossible for many an Adonis.” Beethoven’s antipathy to
teaching before he left Bonn has already been noticed. In Vienna
he developed a still stronger repugnance to playing in society when
requested to do so. He often complained to Wegeler how grievously
this put him out of sorts, whereupon the latter sought to
entertain him and quiet him by conversation. “When this purpose
was reached,” he continues,</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I dropped the conversation, seated myself at the writing table, and
Beethoven, if he wanted to continue the discourse, had to sit down on
the chair before the pianoforte. Soon, still turned away from the instrument,
he aimlessly struck a few chords out of which gradually grew
the most beautiful melodies. Oh, why did I not understand more of
music! Several times I put ruled paper upon the desk as if without
intention, in order to get a manuscript of his; he wrote upon it but then
folded it up and put it in his pocket! Concerning his playing I was
permitted to say but little, and that only in passing. He would then
go away entirely changed in mood and always come back again gladly.
The antipathy remained, however, and was frequently the cause of
differences between Beethoven and his friends and well-wishers.</p></div>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Old Bonn Friends Remembered</span></div>

<p>There is still one other reminiscence of Wegeler in the appendix
to the “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Notizen</span>” (page 9) worthy of citation. “At one time private
lectures were given in Vienna on Kant, which had been
arranged by Adam Schmidt, Wilhelm Schmidt, Hunczovsky, Göpfert
and others. In spite of my urgings Beethoven refused to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
attend a single one of them.” There is no reference in Wegeler’s
“<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Notizen</span>” to instruction received by Beethoven from Albrechtsberger.
With his old colleague in the Court Orchestra in Bonn,
Nicolaus Simrock, though he was a much older man, Beethoven
remained in touch after his removal to Vienna. Simrock, who was
highly esteemed both as man and musician, had embarked in
business as a music publisher in Bonn. The Variations on a theme
from Dittersdorf’s “Rothkäppchen,” were published by him (at
the latest in the early part of 1794), as well as those for pianoforte
four hands on a theme by Count Waldstein (some time in the same
year). It is to the latter composition that the following letter refers:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="dateline">
Vienna, August 2, 1794.</p>

<p class="salut">Dear Simrock:
</p>

<p>I deserve a little scolding from you for holding back your
Variations so long, but, indeed, I do not lie when I say that I was hindered
from correcting them sooner by an overwhelming amount of business.
You will note the shortcomings for yourself, but I must wish you joy on

myself from the imputation as soon as I have finished the grand revision
of my compositions, which will be soon, you shall have something which
you will surely engrave. I have also been looking about me for a commissioner

The Viennese fear that they will soon be unable to eat ice-cream, there
having been little cold last winter and ice being scarce. Many persons
of importance have come here and it was said that a revolution was imminent;
but it is my belief that so long as the Austrian has his dark
beer and sausage he will not revolt. It is said that the suburban gates
are to be closed at ten o’clock at night. The soldiers’ guns are loaded

<p>These “first Variations” obviously are those on the theme from
“Rothkäppchen”; those referred to in the early part of the letter
the ones on Count Waldstein’s theme. The “piece” whose performance
he inquires about is the Octet, and the allusion to it
justifies the belief that it was composed for the wind-instrument
players of Bonn who found no opportunity to play it while Beethoven
was still in his native city. The letter, like that written
to Eleonore von Breuning, shows that Beethoven was still thinking
of the possibility or probability of a return to Bonn. Its
cheerful tone discloses a comfortable, satisfied frame of mind&mdash;the
mood from which the first Trios proceeded.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">First Concert Appearances in Vienna</span></div>

<p>We return to the chronological record of events. The first
of these in the year 1795, was Beethoven’s first appearance in public
as virtuoso and composer. The annual concerts in the Burgtheater
established by Gassmann for the benefit of the widows of
the <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Tonkünstlergesellschaft</span> were announced for the evenings of
March 29 and 30. The vocal work selected for performance was
an oratorio in two parts, “Gioas, Re di Giuda,” by Antonio Cartellieri;
the instrumental, a Concerto for Pianoforte and Orchestra,
composed and played by Ludwig van Beethoven. Cartellieri was
a young man of twenty-three years (born in Danzig, September
27, 1772) who, a year or two since, had come from Berlin to study
operatic composition with the then greatest living composer in
that field, Salieri. As the direction of these Widow and Orphan
concerts was almost exclusively in the hands of Salieri, one is
almost tempted to think that he may on this occasion have indulged
a pardonable vanity in bringing forward two of his pupils,
if we did not know how strong an attraction the name of Beethoven
must have been for the public which, as yet, had had no
opportunity to learn his great powers except by report. The day
of the performance drew near but the Concerto was not yet written
out. “Not until the afternoon of the second day before the concert
did he write the rondo, and then while suffering from a pretty
severe colic which frequently afflicted him. I [Wegeler] relieved
him with simple remedies so far as I could. In the anteroom sat
four copyists to whom he handed sheet after sheet as soon as it
was finished.... At the first rehearsal, which took place the
next day in Beethoven’s room, the pianoforte was found to be
half a tone lower than the wind-instruments. Without a moment’s
delay Beethoven had the wind-instruments and the others tune
to B-flat instead of A and played his part in C-sharp.” Thus
Wegeler in his “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Notizen</span>” (pg. 36). But he has confounded two
compositions. The concerto which Beethoven played on March<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
29, 1795, was not that in C (Op.&nbsp;15) which was not yet finished,
but, in all probability, that in B-flat (Op.&nbsp;19). For the fact that
the Concerto in B-flat was composed before that in C we have the
testimony of Beethoven himself, who wrote to Breitkopf and Härtel
on April 22, 1801: “I simply want to call your attention to the fact
that one of my first Concertos will be published by Hoffmeister,
which is not among my best works, and one also by Mollo which,
though composed later, etc.” The Concerto in B-flat was published
in 1801 by Hoffmeister and that in C in the same year by
Mollo and Co. in Vienna, the latter a little in advance of the former,
wherefore there need be no surprise at the earlier <i>opus</i> number.</p>

<p>Beethoven also took part in the second concert on March 30,
the minutes of the Tonkünstlerschaft recording that he “improvised
on the pianoforte”; and though busily engaged he also embraced
an opportunity to testify to his devotion to the manes of
Mozart. On March 31, 1795, Mozart’s widow arranged a performance
of “La Clemenza di Tito” in the Burgtheater. “After
the first part,” says the advertisement, “Mr. Ludwig van Beethoven
will play a Concerto of Mozart’s composition on the Pianoforte.”
We opine that this concerto was Mozart’s in D minor,
which Beethoven loved especially and for which he wrote cadenzas.</p>

<p>The Trios, Op.&nbsp;1, had now become so well known and appreciated
in musical circles as to justify their publication, and accordingly,
an advertisement inviting subscriptions for Ludwig van Beethoven’s
“three Grand Trios” appeared in the “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Wiener Zeitung</span>”
on May 16, 1795. Three days later a contract was signed by the
author and Artaria and Company. The printed list of subscribers
gives 123 names, mostly belonging to the higher circles, with subscriptions
amounting to 241 copies. As Beethoven paid the publisher
but one florin per copy, and the subscription price was one
ducat, he made a handsome profit out of the transaction.<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">First Pianoforte Trios and Sonatas</span></div>

<p>We must tarry a moment longer with these Trios. That the
author is disposed to place their origin in the Bonn period has
already appeared. Argument in favor of this view can be found
in the fact of their early performance in Vienna, for there can be
no reasonable question of the correctness of Ries’s story, for which
Beethoven himself was authority, that they were played at the
house of Prince Lichnowsky, in the presence of Haydn. This performance
must have taken place before January 19, 1794, because
on that day Haydn started again for England. Now, Beethoven’s
sketches show that he was still working on at least the second and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
third of the Trios after 1794, and that they were not ready for
the printer before the end of that year. Further explanation is
offered by the following little circumstances: since Haydn was
present, the performance at Prince Lichnowsky’s must have been
from manuscript. In the morning meeting which probably took
place only a short time before the soirée, Beethoven’s attention
was called to the desirability of changing in the last movement of
the second Trio, the time-signature from 4-4 to 2-4. Beethoven
made the change. From these facts it may be concluded that
after a first there was a final revision of these Trios and that the
former version disappeared or was destroyed after the latter was
made. It has repeatedly been intimated that the author believes
that the rewriting of compositions completed in Beethoven’s early
period is farther-reaching than is generally assumed. The case
therefore seems to present itself as follows: Haydn heard the Trios
at Lichnowsky’s in their first state; Beethoven then took them up
for revision and in the course of 1794 and the beginning of 1795
brought them to the state in which we know them. It is not
possible to say positively whether or not the first form, particularly
of the first Trio, dates back to the Bonn period.</p>

<p>An interesting anecdote connected with these Trios may well
find place here; it is contributed by Madame Mary de Fouche,
daughter of Tomkison, who, in the seventh decade of the nineteenth
century, was one of the more famous pianoforte manufacturers
of London: In the early days of the century, a little society
of musicians&mdash;J. B. Cramer, the pianist; F. Cramer, violinist, half-brother
of the preceding; J. P. Salomon, whose name has so often
come up in previous chapters of this work; Bridgetower, a
mulatto and celebrated violinist, whose name we shall meet again;
Watts, tenor; Morant, also tenor, who married the great Dussek’s
widow; Dahmen, Lindley and Crossdale, violoncellists&mdash;was in the
habit of meeting regularly at Mr. Tomkison’s to try over and
criticise such new music of the German school as came to the London
dealers. At one of these meetings the new Trios of Beethoven,
Op.&nbsp;1, were played through, J. B. Cramer at the pianoforte. “This
is the man,” he cried, “who is to console us for the loss of Mozart!”
According to the recollection of Cipriani Potter, this was after
Cramer had made the personal acquaintance of Beethoven in
Vienna, and had heard him play there.</p>

<p>Some other incidents recorded by Wegeler belong to this year.
Haydn reached Vienna upon his return from his second visit to
England on August 20. Beethoven had now ready the three
Sonatas, Op.&nbsp;2, and at one of the Friday morning concerts at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
Prince Lichnowsky’s he played them to Haydn, to whom they were
dedicated.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Here (says Wegeler on page 29 of the ‘<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Notizen</span>’), Count Appony
asked Beethoven to compose a quartet for him for a given compensation,
Beethoven not yet having written a piece in this genre. The Count
declared that contrary to custom he did not want to have exclusive
possession of the quartet for half a year before publication, nor did he
ask that it be dedicated to him, etc. In response to repeated urgings
by me, Beethoven twice set about the task, but the first effort resulted
in a grand violin Trio (Op.&nbsp;3), the second in a violin Quintet (Op.&nbsp;4).</p></div>

<p>How much mistaken Wegeler was in these concluding statements
has already been indicated.</p>

<p>The three Pianoforte Sonatas dedicated to Haydn were, therefore,
the second group of compositions which Beethoven considered
illustrative of his artistic ideals and worthy of publication. Nothing
can be said with positiveness touching the time of their origin.
Schönfeld’s words in his “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Jahrbuch der Tonkunst von Wien und
Prag</span>”: “We already have several of his Sonatas, among which his
last are particularly noteworthy,” which were written at least eight
months before the Sonatas appeared in print, lead to the conclusion
that the Sonatas were known in Vienna in manuscript in the spring
of 1795. Their appearance in print was announced in the “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Wiener
Zeitung</span>” of March 9, 1796.</p>

<p>Still another anecdote recorded by Wegeler refers to another
composition of this period: “Beethoven was seated in a box at
the opera with a lady of whom he thought much at a performance
of ‘La Molinara.’ When the familiar <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Nel cor più non mi sento</i> was
reached the lady remarked that she had possessed some variations
on the theme but had lost them. In the same night Beethoven
wrote the six variations on the melody and the next morning sent
them to the lady with the inscription: <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Variazioni, etc., Perdute par
la&mdash;ritrovate par Luigi van Beethoven</i>. They are so easy that it is
likely Beethoven wished that she should be able to play them at
sight.” Paisiello’s “La Molinara,” composed in 1788 for Naples,
was performed on March 8, 1794 in the Court Opera, and again on
June 24 and 27, 1795, in the Kärnthnerthor-Theater in Vienna.
Considering the time of the publication of these unpretentious but
genial little variations, their composition may be set down after
the latter performances. At the same period Beethoven wrote
variations on another theme (<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Quant’ è più bello</i>) from the same
opera, which were published before the former and dedicated to
Prince Carl Lichnowsky. It is likely that a few more sets of
variations, a form of composition for which Beethoven had a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
strong predilection at the time, had their origin in these early years
of Beethoven’s life in Vienna. The Variations in C on the “Menuet
à la Vigano” from the ballet “Le Nozze disturbate,” may confidently
be assigned to the year 1795. The ballet was performed
for the first time on May 18, 1795, at Schikaneder’s theatre; the
Variations are advertised as published on February 27, 1796.</p>

<p>The <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Gesellschaft der bildenden Künstler</span> had, in the year 1792,
established an annual ball in the Redoutensaal in the month of
November; and Haydn, just then returned covered with glory
from England, composed a set of twelve minuets and twelve German
dances for the occasion. In 1793, the Royal Imperial Composer
Kozeluch followed Haydn’s example. In 1794, Dittersdorf
wrote the same number of like dances for the large hall, and Eybler
for the small. In view of this array of great names, and considering
that as yet the Trios, Op.&nbsp;1, were the only works of a higher
order than the Variations which Beethoven had sent to press, the
advertisements for the annual ball to be given upon the 22nd of
November, 1795, give a vivid proof of the high reputation which
the young man had gained as a composer now at the end of his
third year in Vienna. These advertisements conclude thus: “The
music for the Minuets and German dances for this ball is an entirely
new arrangement. For the larger room they were written
by the Royal Imperial Chapelmaster Süssmayr; for the smaller
room by the master hand of Mr. Ludwig van Beethoven out of
love for the artistic fraternity.” These dances, arranged for pianoforte
by Beethoven himself, came from the press of Artaria a few
weeks later, as did also Süssmayr’s; Beethoven’s name in the
advertisement being in large and conspicuous type.</p>

<p>As the year began with the first, so it closed with Beethoven’s
second appearance in public as composer and virtuoso; and here
is the advertisement of the performance from the “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Wiener
Zeitung</span>” of December 16:</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Beethoven Pays Tribute to Haydn</span></div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Next Friday, the 18th instant, Mr. the Chapelmaster Haydn will
give a grand musical concert in the small Redoutensaal, at which Mad.
Tomeoni and Mr. Mombelli will sing. Mr. van Beethoven will play a
Concerto of his composing on the Pianoforte, and three grand symphonies,
not yet heard here, which the Chapelmaster composed during his last
sojourn in London, will be performed.</p></div>

<p>One would gladly know what concerto was played.<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> But
there was little public criticism then outside of London and very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
rarely any in Vienna. The mere fact of the appearance of Beethoven
at his old master’s concert is, however, another proof that
too much stress has been laid upon a hasty word spoken by him
to Ries. Haydn wanted that Beethoven should put “Pupil of
Haydn” on the title-page of his first works. Beethoven was unwilling
to do so because, as he said, “though he had taken some
lessons from Haydn he had never learned anything from him.”
Nothing could be more natural than for Haydn, knowing nothing
of the studies of his pupil with Schenk, to express such a wish in
relation to the Sonatas dedicated to him, and equally natural that
the author should refuse; but to add to the attractions of the concert
was a very different matter&mdash;a graceful and delicate compliment
which he could with pleasure make.</p>

<p>This chapter may appropriately close with the one important
family event of this year. The father, the mother, two infant
brothers and two infant sisters slept in the churchyard at Bonn;
but Ludwig, Caspar and Johann were never more to look upon
their graves. The three brothers were now reunited. Vienna had
become their new home and not one of them beheld the rushing
Rhine again.</p>

<p>The Years 1796 and 1797&mdash;Beethoven in Prague and Berlin&mdash;King
Frederick William II and Prince Louis Ferdinand&mdash;Himmel,
Fasch and Zelter&mdash;Compositions and Publications.</p></div>


<p>The narrative resumes its course with the year 1796, the
twenty-sixth of Beethoven’s life and his fourth in Vienna.
If not yet officially, he was <i>de facto</i> discharged from his
obligations to the Elector Maximilian and all his relations with
Bonn and its people were broken off. Vienna had become his
home, and there is no reason to suppose that he ever afterwards
cherished any real and settled purpose to exchange it for another&mdash;not
even in 1809 when, for the moment, he had some thought of
accepting Jerome Bonaparte’s invitation to Cassel.</p>

<p>He had now entered his course of contrapuntal study with
Albrechtsberger; he was first of the pianoforte players of the capital
and his name added attraction even to the concert which
Haydn, returning again from his London triumphs, had given to
introduce some of his new works to the Viennese; his “master-hand”
was already publicly recognized in the field of musical composition;
he counted many nobles of the higher ranks in his list
of personal friends and had been, perhaps even now was, a member
of Prince Carl Lichnowsky’s family. The change in his pecuniary
condition might have thrown a more equitable temperament than
his off its balance. Three years ago he anxiously noted down the
few kreutzers occasionally spent for coffee or chocolate “für Haidn
und mich”; now he keeps his own servant and a horse. His brothers,
if at all a burden, were no longer a heavy one. Carl Caspar,
according to the best information now obtainable, soon gained
moderate success in the musical profession and, with probably
some occasional aid from Ludwig both pecuniary and in obtaining
pupils, earned sufficient for his comfortable support; while Johann
had secured a situation in that apothecary shop “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Zum Heiligen
Geist</span>” which, in 1860, was still to be seen in the Kärnthnerstrasse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
near the former site of the gate of that name.<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> His wages were,
of course, small and we shall soon see that Ludwig offers him assistance
if needed, though not to Karl; but Johann’s position gradually
improved and he was able in a few years to save enough to enable
him, unaided by his brother, to purchase and establish himself in a
business of his own.<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a></p>

<p>“Fate had become propitious to Beethoven”; and a final citation
from the memorandum book will show in what spirit he was
determined to merit the continuance of Fortune’s favor. If we
make allowance for the old error as to his real age, this citation may
belong to a period a year or two later; but may it not be one of
those extracts from books and periodical publications which all his
life long he was so fond of making? This seems to be the more
probable supposition. The words are these: “Courage! In spite
of all bodily weaknesses my spirit shall rule. You have lived 25
years. This year must determine the complete man. Nothing
must remain undone.”</p>

<p>And now let the chronological narrative of events be resumed.
As the year 1795 had ended with a public appearance of Beethoven
as pianoforte player and composer, so also began the year 1796;
and, as on a former occasion in a concert by Haydn, so this time
he played at a concert given by a singer, Signora Bolla, who
afterward became famous, in the Redoutensaal. Again he played
a pianoforte concerto.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Meeting of Friends in Nuremberg</span></div>

<p>“In 1796,” says Wegeler (“<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Nachträge</span>,” p. 18), “the two older
Breuning brothers, Christoph and Stephan, find him (Beethoven) at
Nuremberg on a return journey to Vienna. Which journey is not
specified. None of the three having a passport from Vienna they
were all detained at Linz, but soon liberated through my intervention
at Vienna.” And from a letter written by Stephan von Breuning
to his mother, dated January, 1796, Wegeler quotes: “From
Nuremberg, Beethoven travelled all the way in company with us.
The three Bonnians thus attracted the attention of the police, who
thought they had made a wonderful discovery. I do not believe
that there could be a less dangerous man than Beethoven.” Wegeler’s
suggestion that Beethoven was returning “perhaps from
Berlin” is of course out of the question. But between the date
of Haydn’s concert (December 18th) and Stephan von Breuning’s
letter, if written towards the end of January, there was ample time,
even in those days of post-coaches, for a journey to Prague and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
thence across the country to Mergentheim or Ellingen, at that time
the temporary residences of Elector Maximilian. The necessity of
Beethoven’s knowing precisely in what relation he was to stand
with the Elector in the future, accounts sufficiently for his being
in Nuremberg at that time, especially if he had had occasion to
visit Prague during the Christmas holidays, which is not improbable.
Dlabacz, in his “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Künstler-Lexikon</span>,” has a paragraph of
which this is a part: “v. Beethoven, a Concertmaster on the pianoforte.
In the year 1795, he gave an academy in Prague at which
he played with universal approval.” It is true that Dlabacz may
here record a concert given during Beethoven’s stay in the Bohemian
capital some weeks later; but, on the one hand, no other
notice of such a concert has been discovered; and, on the other, the
“universal approval” on this occasion may have been an inducement
for him to return thither so soon.</p>

<p>At all events, his delay in Vienna after coming from Nuremberg
was short and was doubtless occupied with the last corrections
of the Sonatas, Op.&nbsp;2, dedicated to Haydn, the six Menuets (second
part), the Variations on the theme from “<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Le Nozze disturbate</span>”
and those on “<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Nel cor più non mi sento</span>,” all of which works are
advertised in the “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Wiener Zeitung</span>” in the course of the next two
months, while their author was again in Prague or cities farther
North. For the following letter we are indebted to Madame van

Dear Brother!
</p>

<p>So that you may at least know where I am and what I am
doing I must needs write you. In the first place I am getting on well&mdash;very
well. My art wins for me friends and respect; what more do I
want? This time, too, I shall earn considerable money. I shall remain
here a few weeks more and then go to Dresden, Leipsic and Berlin. It
will probably be six weeks before I shall return. I hope that you
will be more and more pleased with your sojourn in Vienna; but beware
of the whole guild of wicked women. Have you yet called on Cousin
Elss? You might write to me at this place if you have inclination and
time.</p>

<p>F. Linowsky will probably soon return to Vienna; he has already

still owes me some.</p>

<p>For the rest I hope that your life will grow continually in happiness
and to that end I hope to contribute something. Farewell, dear brother,
and think occasionally of</p>

<p>A debt of gratitude is certainly due Johann van Beethoven
for having carefully preserved this letter for full half a century
and leaving it to his heirs, notwithstanding all the troubles which
afterwards arose between the brothers, since it is hardly more valuable
and interesting for the facts which it states directly than for
what it indicates and suggests more or less clearly.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">A Sojourn in Prague and its Fruits</span></div>

<p>It, with other considerations, render it well nigh certain that
Beethoven had now come to Prague with Prince Lichnowsky as
Mozart had done, seven years before, and that upon leaving
Vienna he had had no intention of pursuing his journey farther;
but encouraged by the success thus reported to his brother, he
suddenly determined to seek instruction and experience, pleasure,
profit and fame in an extended tour. Had he projected this journey
already in Vienna, how could all recollection of it have been lost
by Wegeler? How could von Breuning in the letter cited above have
omitted all mention of it? Nor is it possible to think that Beethoven,
still so young and still so unknown outside the Austrian
and Bohemian capitals, having so many powerful and influential
friends there, and there only, could at this time have gone forth
to seek elsewhere some permanent position with a fixed salary.
The remarks which have been preserved, made by him in writing
or conversation, expressing a desire for such an appointment, all
belong to a later period, and cannot by any torture of language
be made to refer to this, when he was looking into the future with
well-grounded hopes and serene confidence of advancement in his
new home. Vienna seemed to offer him all his ambition could
crave; why should he seek his fortune beyond her walls?</p>

<p>It is pleasant to note his care for the welfare of his brother
Johann, which care, doubtless, the other brother did not need. But
how could Prince Lichnowsky have been indebted to Ludwig?</p>

<p>The musical public of Prague was the same that had so recently
honored itself by its instant and noble appreciation of
Mozart, and had given so glorious a welcome to “Figaro,” “Don<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
Giovanni” and “Titus.” There being no royal or imperial court
there, and the public amusements being less numerous than in
Vienna, the nobility were thrown more on their own resources for
recreation; and hence, besides the traditional taste of the Bohemians
for instrumental music, their capital was, perhaps, a better
field for the virtuoso than Vienna. No notice of any public concert
given by Beethoven on this visit has been discovered, either
in the newspapers of the time or in the reminiscences of Thomaschek
and others; and “the considerable money” earned “this
time” must have been the presents of the nobility for his performances
in their salons, and, perhaps, for compositions.</p>

<p>The conception of the aria “Ah, perfido! spergiuro” is generally
associated with Beethoven’s sojourn in Prague. The belief
rests upon the fact that upon the cover of a copy which he revised
Beethoven wrote the words “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Une grande Scène mise en musique
par L. v. Beethoven à Prague, 1796.</span>” On the first page is written:
<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Recitativo e Aria composta e dedicata alla Signora Contessa di
Clari da L. v. Beethoven</i>. The opus number, 46, in this title is
in the handwriting of Al. Fuchs, who owned a copy. Now, on
November 21st, 1796, Madame Duschek, the well known friend
of Mozart, at a concert in Leipsic sang “An Italian Scena composed
for Madame Duschek by Beethoven,” and it was easy to conclude
that the aria was really written by Beethoven for Madame
Duschek. On a page of sketches preserved in Berlin among others
there are sketches belonging to “Ah, perfido!” which do not agree
with the printed page. On the lower margin of the first page
is the remark: <i>pour Mademoiselle la Comtesse de Clari</i>. Nottebohm
is led by these things to surmise that the aria was written in
Vienna in 1795, before the visit to Prague. In any case, we are
permitted to associate the date 1796 only with the completion of
the work in Prague; and the purpose may well have been to have
it sung by Madame Duschek, who is thus proved to have belonged
to the circle of Beethoven’s friends in Prague. Nevertheless, the
aria was originally intended for the Countess Josephine Clari, a
well known amateur singer who married Count Christian Clam-Gallas
in 1797. The scena first appeared in print in the fall of
1805, when it was published in a collection made by Hoffmeister
and Kühnel. Beethoven placed it upon the programme of his
concert in 1808.</p>

<p>Another family in which Beethoven was received on the footing
of a friend was that of Appellate Councillor Kanka. Both
father and son were dilettante composers and instrumental players&mdash;the
father on the violoncello, the son on the pianoforte.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
Gerber gives them a place in his Lexicon. “Miss Jeanette” (the
daughter), says the eulogistic Schönfeld, “played the pianoforte
with great expression and skill.” The son adopted his father’s
profession, became a distinguished writer on Bohemian law, and in
later years did Beethoven good service as legal adviser.</p>

<p>There is in the Artaria collection, a thick fascicle of sketches
and musical fragments from Beethoven’s hand in which papers
from the Bonn period down to the close of the century are stitched
together in such disorder as to show that they were thus joined
merely for preservation. One sheet of mere sketches bears, if
correctly deciphered, this inscription: “Written and dedicated to
Gr. C. G. as a souvenir of his stay in P.” On the fourth page of
the sheet stands “these 4 Bagtalles by B.” with something more
illegible. May not some yet unknown composition of Beethoven
be still in the possession of the family Clam-Gallas? Count
Christian and his two daughters are numbered by Schönfeld
among the fine pianoforte players of Prague, and these few
notices exhaust the information obtained upon this visit of Beethoven
there. His next appearance is in Berlin. No record has
been found of the proposed visit to either Dresden or Leipsic,
although his journey, it would seem, must have taken him
through the Saxon capital.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Incidents of a Visit to Berlin</span></div>

<p>In after years he was fond of talking about his sojourn in
Berlin, and some particulars have thus been preserved. “He
played,” says Ries,</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>several times at court (that of King Frederick William II), where he
played the two grand sonatas with <i>obbligato</i> violoncello, Op.&nbsp;5, written
for Duport, first violoncellist of the King, and himself. On his departure
he received a gold snuff-box filled with Louis d’ors. Beethoven declared
with pride that it was not an ordinary snuff-box, but such an one as it
might have been customary to give to an ambassador.</p></div>

<p>This king shared his uncle Frederick II’s love for music, while
his taste was better and more cultivated. His instrument was the
violoncello, and he often took part in quartets and sometimes in
the rehearsals of Italian operas. He exerted a powerful and enduring
influence for good upon the musical taste of Berlin. It was
he who caused the operas of Gluck and Mozart to be performed
there and introduced oratorios of Handel into the court concerts.
His appreciation of Mozart’s genius, and his wish to attach that
great master to his court, are well known; and these facts render
credible a statement with which Carl Czerny closes a description
of Beethoven’s extemporaneous playing contributed to Cock’s
“London Musical Miscellany” (August 2nd, 1852):</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>His improvisation was most brilliant and striking. In whatever
company he might chance to be, he knew how to produce such an effect
upon every hearer that frequently not an eye remained dry, while many
would break out into loud sobs; for there was something wonderful in
his expression in addition to the beauty and originality of his ideas and
his spirited style of rendering them. After ending an improvisation of
this kind he would burst into loud laughter and banter his hearers
on the emotion he had caused in them. “You are fools!” he would say.
Sometimes he would feel himself insulted by these indications of sympathy.
“Who can live among such spoiled children?” he would cry, and
only on that account (as he told me) he declined to accept an invitation
which the King of Prussia gave him after one of the extemporary
performances above described.</p></div>

<p>Chapelmaster Reichardt had withdrawn himself from Berlin
two years before, having fallen into disfavor because of his
sympathy with the French Revolution. Neither Himmel nor
Righini, his successors, ever showed a genius for chamber music of
a high order, and, indeed, there was no composer of reputation
in this sphere then living in that quarter. The young Beethoven
by his two sonatas had proved his powers and the King saw in him
precisely the right man to fill the vacancy&mdash;no small proof of superior
taste and judgment. What the German expression was which
the translator of Czerny’s letter has rendered “accept an invitation
which the King gave him” there is no means of knowing; but as
it stands it can only mean an invitation to enter permanently
into his service. The death of the King the next year, of course,
prevented its being ever renewed.</p>

<p>Friedrich Heinrich Himmel, five years older than Beethoven,
whom the King had withdrawn from the study of theology and
caused to be thoroughly educated as a musician, first under Naumann
in Dresden and afterwards in Italy, had returned the year
before and had assumed his duties as Royal Pianist and Composer.
As a virtuoso on his instrument his only rival in Berlin was Prince
Louis Ferdinand, son of Prince August and nephew of Frederick II,
two years younger than Beethoven and endowed by nature with
talents and genius which would have made him conspicuous had
fortune not given him royal descent. He and Beethoven became
well known to each other and each felt and did full justice to the
other’s musical genius and attainments. Now let Ries speak
again:</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Meetings with Himmel, Fasch and Zelter</span></div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In Berlin he (Beethoven) associated much with Himmel, of whom
he said that he had a pretty talent, but no more; his pianoforte playing,
he said, was elegant and pleasing, but he was not to be compared with
Prince Louis Ferdinand. In his opinion he paid the latter a high compliment
when once he said to him that his playing was not that of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
king or prince but more like that of a thoroughly good pianoforte player.
He fell out with Himmel in the following manner: One day when they
were together Himmel begged Beethoven to improvise; which Beethoven
did. Afterwards Beethoven insisted that Himmel do the same.
The latter was weak enough to agree; but after he had played for quite
a time Beethoven remarked: “Well, when are you going fairly to begin?”
Himmel had flattered himself that he had already performed wonders;
he jumped up and the men behaved ill towards each other. Beethoven
said to me: “I thought that Himmel had been only preluding a bit.”
Afterwards they were reconciled, indeed, but Himmel could never forgive
or forget<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a>. They also exchanged letters until Himmel played Beethoven
a shabby trick. The latter always wanted to know the news from Berlin.
This bored Himmel, who at last wrote that the greatest news from Berlin
was that a lamp for the blind had been invented. Beethoven ran about
with the news and all the world wanted to know how this was possible.
Thereupon he wrote to Himmel that he had blundered in not giving
more explicit information. The answer which he received, but which
does not permit of communication, not only put an end to the correspondence
but brought ridicule upon Beethoven, who was so inconsiderate
as to show it then and there.</p></div>

<p>With Carl Friedrich Christian Fasch and Carl Friedrich
Zelter he also made a friendly acquaintance, and twice at least
attended meetings of the <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Singakademie</span>, which then numbered
about 90 voices. The first time, June 21st, says the “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Geschichte
der Singakademie</span>”:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>A chorale, the first three numbers of the mass and the first six
of the 119th Psalm were sung for him. Hereupon he seated himself at
the pianoforte and played an improvisation on the theme of the final
fugue: “Meine Zunge rühmt im Wettgesang dein Lob.” The last numbers
of “Davidiana” (a collection of versets by Fasch) formed the conclusion.
No biographer has mentioned this visit or even his sojourn
in Berlin. Nor does Fasch pay special attention to it; but the performance
must have pleased, for it was repeated at the meeting on the 28th.</p></div>

<p>The performance of the Society must also have pleased
Beethoven, and with good reason; for Fasch’s mass was in sixteen
parts and the psalm and “Davidiana,” in part, in eight; and no
such music was then to be heard elsewhere north of the Alps.</p>

<p>In 1810, Beethoven, speaking of his playing on that occasion,
told Mme. von Arnim (then Elizabeth Brentano) that at the close
his hearers did not applaud but came crowding around him weeping;
and added, ironically, “that is not what we artists wish&mdash;we
want applause!” Fasch’s simple record of Beethoven’s visit is this:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>June 21, 1796. Mr. van Beethoven extemporized on the “Davidiana,”
taking the fugue theme from Ps. 119, No. 16.... Mr. Beethoven,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
pianist from Vienna, was so accommodating as to permit us to hear an
improvisation. . . . June 28, Mr. van Beethoven was again so obliging
as to play an improvisation for us.</p></div>

<p>Early in July, the King left Berlin for the baths of Pyrmont,
the nobility dispersed to their estates or to watering-places, and
the city “was empty and silent.” Beethoven, therefore, could
have had no inducement to prolong his stay; but the precise time
of his departure is unknown. Schindler names Leipsic as one of
the cities in which, during this tour, Beethoven “awakened interest
and created a sensation by his pianoforte playing, and, particularly,
by his brilliant improvisation”; but no allusion in any public
journal of that or any subsequent period, not even the faintest
tradition, has been discovered to confirm the evidently erroneous
statements. Moreover, Rochlitz in his account of a visit to the
composer in 1822 remarks, “I had not yet seen Beethoven”; and
again, “It was only as a youth that he ... passed through
(Leipsic).” So, until some new discovery be made, this must also
find its place in the long list of Schindler’s mistakes.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding Wegeler’s statement (“<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Notizen</span>,” 28) that he
left Beethoven a member of the family of Prince Lichnowsky “in
the middle of 1796,” it is as certain as circumstantial evidence
can well make it that the Doctor and Christoph von Breuning had
returned to Bonn before Beethoven reached Vienna again; but
Stephan and Lenz were still there. The former obtained at this
time an appointment in the Teutonic Order, which so many of his
ancestors had served, and his name appears in the published “Calendars
of the Order” from 1797 to 1803, both inclusive, as “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Hofrathsassessor</span>.”
He then soon departed from Vienna to Mergentheim,
whence he wrote (November 23rd) with other matters the
following upon Beethoven to Wegeler and Christoph:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I do not know whether or not Lenz has written you anything
about Beethoven; but take notice that I saw him in Vienna and that
according to my mind, which Lenz has confirmed, he has become somewhat
staider, or, perhaps I should say, has acquired more knowledge
of humanity through travels (or was it because of the new ebullition
of friendship on his arrival?) and a greater conviction of the scarceness
and value of good friends. A hundred times, dear Wegeler, he wishes
you here again, and regrets nothing so much as that he did not follow
much of your advice. (“<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Notizen</span>,” page 19.)</p></div>

<p>Except this notice of his bearing and demeanor, there is a
complete hiatus in Beethoven’s history from his appearance in the
<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Singakademie</span> until the following November. The so-called
Fischoff Manuscript has, it is true, a story of a “dangerous illness”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
which was caused by his own imprudence this summer; but as it
is in date utterly irreconcilable with other known facts, it will
receive its due consideration hereafter. The most plausible suggestion
is that coming back, flushed with victory, with the success
of his tour and delighted with the novelty of travelling at his ease,
he made that excursion to Pressburg and Pesth of which afterwards
Ries was informed and made record (“<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Notizen</span>,” page 109), but
of which no other account is known.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Attempts at Patriotic Music</span></div>

<p>And thus we come to November. This was the year of that
astounding series of victories ending at Arcole, gained by the young
French general Napoleon Bonaparte. The Austrian government
and people alike saw and feared the danger of invasion, a general
uprising took place and volunteer corps were formed in all quarters.
For the Vienna corps, Friedelberg wrote his “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Abschiedsgesang an
Wiens Bürger beim Auszug der Fahnen-Division der Wiener Freiwilliger</span>,”
and Beethoven set it to music. The original printed
edition bears date “November 15, 1795.” It does not appear to
have gained any great popularity, and a drinking-song (“<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Lasst das
Herz uns froh erheben</span>”) was afterwards substituted for Friedelberg’s
text, and published by Schott in Mayence.</p>

<p>The rapid progress of the French army had caused the Germans
in Italy to become distrustful of the future and to hasten
homeward. Among them were Beethoven’s old companions in
the Bonn orchestra, the cousins Andreas and Bernhard Romberg,
who in the spring of this year (May 26th), had kissed the hand of
the Queen of Naples, daughter of the Empress Maria Theresia,
and then departed to Rome to join another friend of the Bonn
period, Karl Kügelgen. The three coming north arrived at Vienna
in the autumn; the Rombergs remained there for a space with
Beethoven, while Kügelgen proceeded to Berlin. Baron von
Braun&mdash;not to be mistaken for Beethoven’s “first Mæcenas” the
Russian Count Browne&mdash;had heard the cousins the year before in
Munich and invited them “to give Vienna an opportunity to hear
them.” There is no notice of their concert in the Vienna newspapers
of the period, and the date is unknown. From Lenz von
Breuning is gleaned an additional fact which alone gives interest
to the concert for us. He writes to Wegeler in January, 1797&mdash;not
1796, as erroneously printed in the appendix to the “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Notizen</span>,” page
20&mdash;and after the meeting with the von Breunings at Nuremberg:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Beethoven is here again;<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> he played in the Romberg concert. He
is the same as of old and I am glad that he and the Rombergs still get
along with each other. Once he was near a break with them; I interceded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
and achieved my end to a fair extent. Moreover, he thinks a great
deal of me just now.</p></div>

<p>It it clear that the Rombergs, under the circumstances, must
have largely owed their limited success to Beethoven’s name and
influence. In February, 1797, they were again in their old positions
in Schroeder’s orchestra in Hamburg.</p>

<p>Beethoven during this winter must be imagined busily engaged
with pupils and private concerts, perhaps also with his
operatic studies with Salieri, certainly with composition and with
preparation for and the oversight of various works then passing
through the press; for in February and April, Artaria advertises
the two Violoncello Sonatas, Op.&nbsp;5, the Pianoforte Sonata for four
hands, Op.&nbsp;6, the Trio, Op.&nbsp;3, the Quintet, Op.&nbsp;4, and the Twelve
Variations on a Danse Russe; these last are the variations which
he dedicated to the Countess Browne and which gave occasion
for the anecdote related by Ries illustrating Beethoven’s forgetfulness;
for this dedication he had</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>received a handsome riding-horse from Count Browne as a gift. He
rode the animal a few times, soon after forgot all about it and, worse
than that, its food also. His servant, who soon noticed this, began to
hire out the horse for his own benefit and, in order not to attract the
attention of Beethoven to the fact, for a long time withheld from him
all bills for fodder. At length, however, to Beethoven’s great amazement
he handed in a very large one, which recalled to him at once his horse
and his neglectfulness. (“<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Notizen</span>,” page 120.)</p></div>

<p>On Thursday, April 6, 1797, Schuppanzigh gave a concert, on
the programme of which Beethoven’s name figured twice. Number
2 was an “Aria by Mr. van Beethoven, sung by Madame
Tribolet (-Willmann);” No. 3 was “a Quintet for Pianoforte and 4
wind-instruments, played and composed by Mr. L. v. Beethoven.”
This was the beautiful Quintet, Op.&nbsp;16, the time of whose origin is
thus more definitely indicated than in the “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Chronologisches Verzeichniss</span>,”
a fact for which we are indebted to Nottebohm.</p>

<p>But the war was renewed and the thoughts of the Viennese
were occupied with matters more serious than the indulgence of
their musical taste. On the 16th of March, Bonaparte forced the
passage of the Tagliamento and Isonzo. During the two weeks
following he had conquered the greater part of Carniola, Carinthia
and the Tyrol, and was now rapidly approaching Vienna. On the
11th of February, Lorenz Leopold Hauschka’s “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Gott erhalte unsern
Kaiser</span>” with Haydn’s music had been sung for the first time in the
theatre and now, when, on April 7th, the Landsturm was called out,
Friedelberg produced his war-song “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Ein grosses, deutsches Volk<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
sind wir</span>,” to which Beethoven also gave music. The printed copy
bears date April 14th, suggesting the probability that it was sung
on the occasion of the grand consecration of the banners which
took place on the Glacis on the 17th. Beethoven’s music was,
however, far from being so fortunate as Haydn’s, and seems to
have gained as little popularity as his previous attempt; but as
the preliminaries to a treaty of peace were signed at Leoben on
the 18th, and the armies, so hastily improvised, were dismissed
three weeks afterwards, the taste for war-songs vanished.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">A Quiet and Uneventful Period</span></div>

<p>The little that is known of Beethoven’s position as a teacher
at this period is very vague and unsatisfactory; enough, however,
to render it sufficiently certain that he had plenty of pupils, many
of them young ladies of high rank who paid him generously. In
the triple capacity of teacher, composer and pianist his gains were
large and he was able to write in May to Wegeler that he was
doing well and steadily better.</p>

<p>It is very possible that the illness mentioned by the Fischoff
Manuscript may have occurred during this summer. There can
be little doubt that the original authority for the statement is
Zmeskall, and therefore the fact of such an attack may be accepted
as certain, but the date&mdash;being, as there given, clearly wrong, as
well as the inference that in it lay the original cause of the composer’s
subsequent loss of hearing&mdash;must be left mainly to conjecture.
From May to November, 1797, Beethoven’s history is
still a blank and nothing but the utter silence of Lenz von Breuning
in his correspondence with his family at Bonn on a topic so
likely to engage his sympathies as the dangerous illness of his
friend, appears to prevent the filling of this blank in part by
throwing him upon a bed of sickness. True, Lenz may have
written and the letter have been lost or destroyed; or he may
have neglected to write because of his approaching departure
from Vienna, which took place in the autumn. His album, still
preserved, has among its contributors Ludwig and Johann van
Beethoven and Zmeskall. Ludwig wrote as follows:</p>

<p class="salut">

<p>They never met again. Lenz died on April 10th of the following
year. In November, Beethoven enjoyed a singular compliment
paid him by the association of the <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Bildende Künstler</span>&mdash;a repetition
of his minuets and trios composed two years before for the artists’
ball; and on the 23rd of December, he again contributed to the
attractions of the Widows’ and Orphans’ Concert by producing
the Variations for two Oboes and English Horn on “Là ci darem
la mano,” played by Czerwenka, Reuter and Teimer. His publications
in 1797, besides those mentioned at the beginning of the
year, were the Twelve Variations for Pianoforte and Violoncello
on the theme from Handel’s “Judas Maccabæus,” precise date
unknown; the Pianoforte Sonata, Op.&nbsp;7; and the Serenade, Op.&nbsp;8,
both advertised by Artaria and Co., October 7th. Finally, the
Rondo in C, Op.&nbsp;51, No. 1, published by Artaria with the catalogue
number 711.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>We come to a consideration of the facts touching the compositions
of the years 1796 and 1797.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">The Composition of “Adelaide”</span></div>

<p>Among the most widely known of these is “Adelaide.” The
composition of this song must have been begun in the first half
of 1795, if not earlier, for sketches of it are found among the
exercises in double counterpoint written for Albrechtsberger.
Other sheets containing sketches for “Adelaide” and the setting
of Bürger’s “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Seufzer eines Ungeliebten</span>” are preserved in the library
of the <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Gesellschaft der Musikfreunde</span> in Vienna and the British
Museum in London. The song was published by Artaria in 1797,
under the title “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Adelaide von Matthisson. Eine Kantate für eine
Singstimme mit Begleitung des Klaviers. In Musik gesetzt und
dem Verfasser gewidmet von Ludwig van Beethoven.</span>” The opus
number 46 was given to it later. In 1800 Beethoven sent a copy of
the song to the poet and accompanied it with the following letter:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="salut">Most honored Sir!</p>

<p>You are herewith receiving from me a composition which has been
in print for several years, but concerning which you probably, to my
shame, know nothing. Perhaps I can excuse myself and explain how
it came about that I dedicated something to you which came so warmly
from my heart yet did not inform you of the fact, by saying that at
first I was unaware of your place of residence, and partly also I was
diffident, not knowing but that I had been over-hasty in dedicating a
work to you without knowing whether or not it met with your approval.</p>

<p>Even now I send you “Adelaide” with some timidity. You know
what changes are wrought by a few years in an artist who is continually
going forward; the greater the progress one makes in art the less<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
one is satisfied with one’s older works. My most ardent wish will be
fulfilled if my musical setting of your heavenly “Adelaide” does not
wholly displease you, and if it should move you soon to write another
poem of its kind, and you, not finding my request too immodest, should
send it to me at once, I will put forth all my powers to do your beautiful
poetry justice. Look upon the dedication as partly a token of the
delight which the composition of your A. gave me, partly as an evidence
of my gratitude and respect for the blessed pleasure which your poetry
has always given, <i>and always will</i> give me.</p>

<p>Whether or not Matthisson answered this letter is not known;
but when he republished “Adelaide” in the first volume of his
collected poems in 1815, he appended to it a note to this effect:
“Several composers have vitalized this little lyric fantasy with
music; but according to my strong conviction none of them so
threw the text into the shade with his melody as the highly gifted
Ludwig van Beethoven in Vienna.” The “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Opferlied</span>,” the words
of which were also written by Matthisson, is one of the poems to
which Beethoven repeatedly recurred. “It seems always to have
presented itself to him as a prayer,” says Nottebohm. Its last
words, “The beautiful to the good,” were written in autograph
albums even in his later years. The origin of the composition
is to be ascribed to 1795, as Nottebohm enters it in his catalogue.
It was thus possible for Wegeler to know it in 1797, when he put
a Masonic text under the music. It had not yet been published
at that time, however, which fact accounts for the discovery of
sketches for it in a sketchbook of 1798-1799 described by Nottebohm.</p>

<p>It was not published until later, probably in 1808, when it
came with two other songs from the press of Simrock. Beethoven
composed the poem a second time, utilizing the beginning of his
first melody, for solo, chorus and orchestra (Op.&nbsp;121b). To this
setting we shall recur hereafter. There is still another song which
must be brought into the story of this period. It is the “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Seufzer
eines Ungeliebten</span>,” with its two parts based on two independent
but related poems by Bürger. Particular interest attaches to the
second part, “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Gegenliebe</span>,” from the fact that its melody was used
afterward by Beethoven for the variations in the “Choral Fantasia,”
Op.&nbsp;80. Sketches for this melody are found associated
with sketches for “Adelaide” on a sheet in the archives of the
<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Gesellschaft der Musikfreunde</span>. Nottebohm fixes the year of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
song’s origin as 1795. It was first published as late as 1837 by
Diabelli along with the song, “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Turteltaube, du klagest</span>,” which was
composed much later. The Italian song, “<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">O care selve, o cara
felice libertà</span>” (from Metastasio’s “Olimpiade”), entered under
number 1264 in Thayer’s “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Chronologisches Verzeichniss</span>,” appears
as a chorus for three voices at the end of the Albrechtsberger
exercises, and hence may be placed in the year 1795, as is done by
Nottebohm, who adds that it originated simultaneously with the
setting of “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Wer ist ein freier Mann?</span>” Here mention must also
be made of two arias which Beethoven wrote for introduction in
Umlauf’s comic opera “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Die schöne Schusterin</span>.” These songs were
assigned to the Bonn period in the first edition of this biography
because the opera was performed in Bonn in the years 1789 and
1790. The two songs composed by Beethoven are an arietta, or
rather strophic song, “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">O welch’ ein Leben</span>,” for tenor, and an aria,
“<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Soll ein Schuh nicht drücken?</span>” for soprano. The words of the
latter are in the original libretto. The words of the tenor song,
though not part of the original text, were obviously written for
the opera. The melody was afterward used by Beethoven as a
setting for Goethe’s “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Mailied</span>,” published in 1805, as Op.&nbsp;52. Both
songs, as written for the opera, were published for the first time
in the Complete Edition of Beethoven’s works from the copies
preserved in the Berlin Library.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Numerous Pieces of Chamber Music</span></div>

<p>Most important of the instrumental compositions of this
period is the Quintet for Strings, Op.&nbsp;4, which is frequently set
down as an arrangement (or revised transcription) of the Octet,
Op.&nbsp;103. The Quintet, however, though it employs the same
motivi as the Octet, is an entirely new work, made so by the radical
changes of structure&mdash;changes of register to adapt the themes to
the stringed instruments and changes in the themes themselves.
The origin of the Quintet can be placed anywhere in the period
from 1792 (when the Octet was probably begun) to the beginning
of 1797, when the Quintet was advertised as “wholly new.” There
is a clue in the Wegeler anecdote already related in connection
with the String Trio, Op.&nbsp;3, in the chapter of this work devoted to
the works composed in Bonn. In 1795, Count Appony commissioned
Beethoven to compose a quartet, the honorarium being
fixed. Wegeler’s recollection was that Beethoven twice undertook
the task; but the first effort resulted in the String Trio and the
second in “a quintet (Op.&nbsp;4).” There is not sufficient internal
evidence to reject the story so far as it affects the Quintet (the
Trio has already been subjected to study), and from its structure
it might well be argued that the composition was undertaken as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
quartet and expanded into a quintet in the hands of the composer.
If Count Appony’s commission was given in 1795, the date of the
completion of the Quintet may be set down as 1796. Artaria,
who published the work, advertised it in the “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Wiener Zeitung</span>” of
February 8th, 1797.</p>

<p>The two Sonatas for Pianoforte and Violoncello, Op.&nbsp;5, belong
to the year 1796, and are the fruits of the visit to Berlin. There is
no reason to question Ries’s story that Beethoven composed them
for Pierre Duport and played them with him. The dedication to
Friedrich Wilhelm II and the character of the works lend credibility
to Ries’s account of their origin. Beethoven played them with
Bernhard Romberg in Vienna at the close of 1796 or beginning of
1797, and they were published soon afterward, being advertised
by Artaria in the “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Wiener Zeitung</span>” of February 8th, 1797. The
Twelve Variations on a theme from Handel’s “Judas Maccabæus,”
were published by Artaria in 1797, dedicated to the Princess Lichnowsky,
<i>née</i> Countess Thun. There were no performances of
Handel’s oratorios in Vienna at this time, but it is not improbable
that the suggestion for the Variations came from Baron van
Swieten.</p>

<p>Here seems to be the place to refer to the Allegro movement
in sonata-form for viola and violoncello which Beethoven gave the
title, “Duett mit zwei Augengläsern obbligato von L. v. Beethoven”
(Duet with two Eyeglasses obbligato, by L. v. Beethoven),
to be found in the volume of sketches from this period (1784-1800)
which the British Museum bought from J. N. Kafka in 1875.<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a>
There ought to be a hint as to the identity of the two players
“with two eyeglasses obbligato.” Here is also the place for the
three Duos for Clarinet and Bassoon first published by André in
Offenbach. The Sextet for Wind-Instruments published by Breitkopf
and Härtel in 1810 (it received the opus number 71 later),
belongs to this period. Sketches for the last movement, which
differ from the ultimate form, however, are found amongst the
sketches for the Pianoforte Sonata, Op.&nbsp;10, No. 3. The inception
of the Sonata must fall sometime between the middle of 1796 and
the middle of 1798, since the subscription for it was opened in the
beginning of July, 1798, and other works of a similar character
were already completed in 1797. It is, therefore, possible to place
the origin of the earlier movements of the Sextet in an earlier
period, say 1796-97, a proceeding which is confirmed by the circumstance
that the beginning is found before sketches for “Ah,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
perfido!” (which was composed in 1796 at the latest), on a sheet of
sketches in the Artaria collection. The Kafka volume of sketches
in the British Museum contains sketches for the minuet and trio
of the Sextet, “Ah, perfido!” and the Pianoforte Sonata, Op.&nbsp;49,
No. 2. This fact also indicates the year 1796. Beethoven let the
work lie a long time. It had its first hearing at a chamber concert
for the benefit of Schuppanzigh in April, 1805; but it was not
until 1809 that he gave it out for publication. On August 3rd
of that year he wrote to Breitkopf and Härtel: “By the next mail-coach
you will receive a song, <i>or perhaps two</i>, and a sextet for wind-instruments,”
and on August 8th: “The sextet is one of my earlier
things and, moreover, was written in a single night&mdash;nothing can
really be said of it beyond that it was written by an author who at
least has produced a few better works; yet for many people such
works are the best.” The statement that the work was written
in a single night must be taken in a Pickwickian sense, for sketches
of it have been found.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Predilection for Wind-Instruments</span></div>

<p>It is plain that at this time Beethoven had a particular predilection
for wind-instruments. Erich Prieger owned a fragment
of a Quintet in E-flat for Oboe, three Horns and Bassoon, formerly
in the possession of Artaria. The beginning of the first movement
is lacking, but can be supplied from the repetition in the second
part. The Adagio is intact, but there are only a few measures of
the Minuet. Influenced, no doubt, by the performances of such
compositions, Beethoven composed at this time two works for two
oboes and English horn. Nottebohm surmises that they were instigated
by a terzetto for two oboes and English horn composed
by a musician named Wendt and performed at a concert of the
<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Tonkünstler-Gesellschaft</span> by three brothers, Johann, Franz and
Philipp Teimer, on December 23rd, 1793. One of the two works,
the Trio which was published as Op.&nbsp;87, is pretty well known,
since it was made accessible to wider circles by arrangements published
in Beethoven’s day and with his approval. Artaria published
it in April, 1806, without opus number. He also published
it for two violins and viola as Op.&nbsp;29, and finally as a Sonata for
Pianoforte and Violin. The last transcription was published first,
as stated in Thayer’s Catalogue. Nothing of a historical nature
is known of the Variations on “Là ci darem” for the same instruments
beyond the fact that they were performed on December
23rd, 1797, at the concert for the benefit of the Widows and Orphans
in the National Court Theatre. On a free page of the autograph
(after the sixth variation) there are some miscellaneous sketches,
among them a motive for the Adagio of Op.&nbsp;3, another which was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
used in the Serenade, Op.&nbsp;25, and, more remarkable still, a few
measures of “Adelaide,” on which he was at work in 1793, and
which appeared in print in 1797. Obviously, the Variations were
finished, and we may set down at the latest the year 1795 for their
beginning.</p>

<p>The Sextet for four stringed instruments and two horns, Op.
81b, also belongs to this early period and in all likelihood was conceived
before the Sextet for wind-instruments. Sketches for the
first two movements are upon a sheet in the Berlin library by the
side of sketches for the song, “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Seufzer eines Ungeliebten</span>.”
Sketches for this song keep company with some for “Adelaide.”
The Sextet is therefore to be credited to the year 1795, or perhaps
1794. It was published in 1819 by Simrock in Bonn. In a letter
which Beethoven sent to Simrock with the MS. (but which has
been lost) he had written to the publisher, who was an admirable
horn player, that “the pupil had given his master many a hard
nut to crack.” As to whether or not, and if so when and where,
the Sextet had been played before being sent to Simrock there is,
as yet, no conclusive evidence.</p>

<p>The beautiful Quintet in E flat, Op.&nbsp;16, for Pianoforte and
Wind-instruments, was played at a concert given by Schuppanzigh
on April 6th, 1797, being number 5 on the programme which described
it as “A Quintet for the Fortepiano accompanied by four
Wind-Instruments, played and composed by Mr. Ludwig van
Beethoven.” It had probably been completed not long before.
Sketches are found in connection with a remark concerning the
Sonata in C minor, Op.&nbsp;10, No. 1.</p>

<p>It was in all probability composed between 1794 and the beginning
of 1797. In the minutes of a meeting of the <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Tonkünstler-Gesellschaft</span>
under date May 10th, 1797, occurs this entry: “On
the second day Mr. van Beethoven produced a Quintet and distinguished
himself in the Quintet and incidentally by an improvisation.”
The word “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">dabey</span>” (incidentally) seems to indicate that
he introduced an improvisation in the Quintet as he did on a later
occasion to the embarrassment of the other players, but to the
delight of the listeners. Ries tells the story in his “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Notizen</span>,”
p. 79. It was at a concert at which the famous oboist Friedrich
Ramm, of Munich, took part.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In the final Allegro there occur several holds before a resumption
of the theme. At one of these Beethoven suddenly began to improvise,
took the Rondo as a theme and entertained himself and the others for
a considerable space; but not his associates. They were displeased, and
Ramm even enraged (<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">aufgebracht</i>). It really was comical to see these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
gentlemen waiting expectantly every moment to go on, continually
lifting their instruments to their lips, then quietly putting them down
again. At last Beethoven was satisfied and dropped again into the
Rondo. The entire audience was delighted.</p></div>

<p>Wasielewski doubts the correctness of the story, since there is
but one hold in the Finale. Dr. Deiters thought that Ries confounded
the last with the first movement, in which the clarinet
enters after a <i>fermata</i>. The Quintet was published by Mollo in
Vienna in 1801, and was dedicated to Prince Schwarzenberg. It
appeared simultaneously in one arrangement made by Beethoven
himself as a Quartet for Pianoforte and Strings, as Ries expressly
declares. Beethoven had nothing to do with the arrangement as
a String Quartet published by Artaria as Op.&nbsp;75.</p>

<p>Touching the history of the Serenade for Violin, Viola and
Violoncello, Op.&nbsp;8, little else is known beyond the fact that its
publication was announced in the “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Wiener Zeitung</span>” on October
7th, 1797, by Artaria. Mr. Shedlock called attention in the
“Musical Times” of 1892 (p. 525) to sketches which appeared
along with others of the Pianoforte Concerto in B-flat, and the
Trio, Op.&nbsp;1, No. 2. That Beethoven valued the work highly is a
fair deduction from the fact that he published it soon after its
composition and authorized the publication of an arrangement for
Pianoforte and Viola which he had revised. This arrangement
received the opus number 42, though probably not from Beethoven.
Hoffmeister in Leipzig, who published it in 1804, under the title
“<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Notturno pour Fortepiano et Alto arrangé d’un Notturno pour
Violon, Alto et Violoncello et revu par l’auteur&mdash;Œuvre 42,</span>” advertised
it in the “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Intelligenzblatt der Zeitschrift für die elegante
Welt</span>” on December 17, 1803. It is this arrangement, no doubt,
to which Beethoven referred in a letter to Hoffmeister, dated
September 22nd, 1803, in which he said: “These transcriptions
are not mine, though they were much improved by me in places.
Therefore, I am not willing to have you state that I made them,
for that would be a lie and I could find neither time nor patience
for such work.” According to the view of Dr. Deiters, which was
shared also by Nottebohm, the Serenade, Op.&nbsp;25, also belongs here.
It was probably composed before Op.&nbsp;8. Beethoven entrusted its
publication in the beginning of 1802 to Cappi, who had just begun
business. Then, like Op.&nbsp;8, it was published by Hoffmeister as
Op.&nbsp;41, in an arrangement for Pianoforte and Flute (or Violin),
which, no doubt, was included in Beethoven’s protest against being
set down as the transcriber.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">A Group of Pianoforte Sonatas</span></div>

<p>Prominent among the compositions of this time is the Sonata
in E-flat for Pianoforte, Op.&nbsp;7. The only evidence of the date of
its composition is the announcement of its publication by Artaria
in the “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Wiener Zeitung</span>” of October 7th, 1797. There are sketches
for the third movement in the Kafka volume, but they afford no
help in fixing a date. The Sonata is inscribed to the Countess
Babette Keglevich, one of Beethoven’s pupils, who afterwards
married Prince Innocenz Odescalchi in Pressburg. Nottebohm
quotes the following from a letter written by a nephew of the
Countess: “The Sonata was composed for her when she was still
a maiden. It was one of the hobbies, of which he (Beethoven)
had many, that, living as he did <i>vis-à-vis</i>, he came in morning
gown, slippers and tasseled cap (<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Zipfelmütze</i>) to give her lessons.”
Inasmuch as the sketches mentioned belong only to the third
movement and the sheet contains the remark: “diverse 4 bagatelles
de inglese Ländler, etc.,” Nottebohm supposes that the movement
was originally intended for one of the Bagatelles and was later
incorporated in the Sonata. It is very probable that the two
little Sonatas, Op.&nbsp;49, belong to this period. Everybody knows
that the second movement of the second Sonata (the minuet) is
based on the same motive as the third movement of the Septet.
That the motive is older in the Sonata than in the Septet is
proved by the fact that sketches for it are found along with some
to “Ah, perfido!” (1795-96) and the Sextet for Wind-instruments,
Op.&nbsp;71. This circumstance establishes its early origin, say in
1795 or, at latest, 1796. Nottebohm considers it likely that the
first Sonata was finished at the latest in 1798, certainly before
the Sonata “Pathétique” and the Trio for strings, Op.&nbsp;9, No. 3.
The Sonatas were ready for publication as early as 1802, in which
year brother Carl offered them to André in Offenbach. They
were not published until 1805, when they appeared with the
imprint of the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Bureau d’Arts et d’Industrie</span>, as appears from an
advertisement in the “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Wiener Zeitung</span>” of January l9th, 1805.
Here, too, belongs the little Sonata in D for four hands, Op.&nbsp;6,
published by Artaria in October, 1797, as Nottebohm surmises.
It was probably composed for purposes of instruction. Except
a few trifles (marches, and two sets of variations) Beethoven
wrote nothing more for four hands, though Diabelli offered him
40 ducats for a four-hand sonata in 1824.</p>

<p>In the pianoforte compositions of these two years are to be
included the Variations in A on a Russian dance from the ballet
“<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Das Waldmädchen</span>,” published in April, 1797, and dedicated to
the Countess Browne, <i>née</i> Bietinghoff. “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Das Waldmädchen</span>,” by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
Traffieri, music by Paul Wranitzky, was first performed at the
Kärnthnerthor-Theater on September 28, 1796, and was repeated
sixteen times the same year. This fixes the time of the composition
of the Variations approximately. They were probably written
before the end of 1796.</p>

<p>There are a few other compositions brought to light by Nottebohm
and Mandyczewski, which call for notice. No. 299, Series
XXV (Supplement), B. and H. Complete Works, is an Allegretto
in C minor, &frac34; time; No. 295 a Bagatelle, also in C minor &frac34;,
Presto, sketches for which are associated with those for the C
minor Sonata, Op.&nbsp;10, No. 1. From the remark: “Very short
minuets to the new sonatas. The Presto remains for that in C
minor,” written about this time Nottebohm concludes that this
Bagatelle was conceived as an intermezzo in the C minor Sonata,
and that, possibly, the Allegretto had a similar origin.<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a></p>

<p>A unique place among Beethoven’s early works is occupied by
the two pieces for mandolin with pianoforte accompaniment first
published in the Complete Edition. Thayer, who knew of the
sketches at Artaria’s, but seems not to have seen the composition
recovered by Nottebohm, which is called Sonatine, associated
Beethoven’s purpose with Krumpholz, who was a virtuoso on the
mandolin; but Mylich, Amenda’s student companion, may have
been in the composer’s mind.</p>

<p>The fact that no compositions for orchestra save the dances
for the Redoutensaal, to be referred to presently, have been preserved,
is not to be taken as conclusive evidence that Beethoven
did not venture into the field of orchestral music in the Bonn and
early Vienna days. Such an assertion is less likely to be made now
than before the discovery of the two Imperial cantatas of 1790.
Moreover, Mr. Shedlock’s extracts from the Kafka sketchbook in
the British Museum show that Beethoven tried his youthful hand
at a symphony. Among the earliest of the sketches there is one
in C minor marked “Sinfonia,” which begins as follows:</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/zill_t210.png" width="500" height="69" alt="sketch" />
</div>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">The “Jena” Symphony and Some Dances</span></div>

<p>Nottebohm notes the theme also in his “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Zweite Beethoveniana</span>”
(p. 577). Shedlock’s contention that out of this theme grew the
second movement of the first Pianoforte Quartet (composed in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
1785) is incontestable. The symphonic sketch is therefore of
earlier date than 1785. In 1909, Prof. Fritz Stein, Musical Director
of the University of Jena, announced that in the collection of music
of the Academic Concerts, founded in 1780, he had discovered the
complete parts of a symphony in four movements in C “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">par Louis
van Beethoven</span>.” These words are in the handwriting of the copyist
on the second violin part; on the ’cello part is written: “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Symphonie
von Beethoven</span>.” Dr. Hugo Riemann,<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> after a glance
through the score prepared by Prof. Stein and put at his disposal,
gave it as his opinion that the symphony might well be a composition
by Beethoven. Thematically, he says it suggests partly
the Mannheim school, partly Haydn; the instrumentation is
nearer Mozart than Stamitz or Cannabich.</p>

<p>Mention of Beethoven’s orchestral dances has already been
made. Schindler’s remark that the musicians of Vienna “refused
citizenship” to Beethoven’s efforts to write Austrian dance music
is discredited, at least so far as Viennese society is concerned, by
the success of his dances composed for the Redoutensaal and the
very considerable number of his waltzes, ländlers, minuets, écossaises,
allemandes and contra-dances which have been preserved.
Only the smaller portion of these dances have been included in the
Complete Edition of Breitkopf and Härtel. Thus in Series II
there are 12 minuets and 12 German dances; in Series XXV
(Supplement), 6 “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Ländrische Tänze</span>” for two violins and bass, 6
German dances for pianoforte and violin, and, for pianoforte alone,
6 German dances, 6 écossaises and a few miscellaneous dances;
in Series XVIII (Small Pieces for Pianoforte) there are 6 minuets
and 13 “Ländrische” (1-6 identical with those numbered 7-13 in
Series II, but transcribed). There are many dances as yet unpublished.
For instance, among the Artaria MSS, purchased by
Erich Prieger, there are 12 écossaises, of which 6 are as yet unknown,
also 12 “Deutsche” for pianoforte and 6 minuets for two
violins and bass, which have never been printed. The three
orchestral dances noted by Thayer in the Thematic Catalogue as
No. 290, of the Artaria collection, are Nos. 3, 9 and 11 of the
12 minuets which A. von Perger discovered in the archives of the
<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Künstler-Pensions-Institut</span> in 1872, and which were published by
Hengel in Paris in pianoforte transcription in 1903 and in score and
parts in 1906, edited by Chantavoine. They were composed for
the <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Künstlersocietät</span> and are now in the Court Library at Vienna.

<p>General Bernadotte&mdash;His Connection with the “Heroic”
Symphony&mdash;Rival Pianists&mdash;J. Wölffl&mdash;Dragonetti and
Cramer&mdash;Compositions of the Years 1798 and 1799.</p></div>


<p>Early in the year 1798, a political event occurred which
demands notice here from its connection with one of
Beethoven’s noblest and most original works&mdash;the “Sinfonia
Eroica.” The singular tissue of error which, owing to
carelessness in observing dates, has been woven in relation to its
origin may be best destroyed by a simple statement of fact.</p>

<p>The extraordinary demands made by the French Directory
upon the Austrian government as preliminary to the renewal of
diplomatic intercourse, after the peace of Campo Formio&mdash;such as
a national palace and French theatre for the minister and the
right of jurisdiction over all Frenchmen in the Austrian dominions&mdash;all
of which were rejected by the Imperial government, had
aroused to a high pitch the public curiosity both as to the man who
might be selected for the appointment and as to the course he
might adopt. This curiosity was by no means diminished by the
intelligence that the new minister was Jean Baptiste Bernadotte,
the young general who had borne so important a part in the recent
invasion of Istria. He arrived in Vienna on February 5th, 1798.
The state of the Empress’s health, who was delivered of the Archduchess
Maria Clementine on the 1st of March, delayed the private
audience of Bernadotte for the presentation of his credentials to
the Emperor until the second of that month, and his public audience
until the 8th of April. During the festivities of the court, which
then took place, Bernadotte was always present, and a reporter of
that day says both the Emperor and Empress held more conversation
with him than with any other of the “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cercle</span>.” This familiar
intercourse, however, came speedily to an end; for on the 13th
Bernadotte had the rashness to display the hated tricolor from his
balcony and to threaten to defend it by force. A riot occurred,
and it was thought that in the extreme excitement of popular feeling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
nothing but the strong detachments of cavalry and infantry detailed
for his protection saved his life&mdash;saved it to ascend the throne
of Sweden on the twentieth anniversary of his arrival in Vienna!</p>

<p>Since etiquette allowed a foreign minister neither to make nor
receive visits in his public capacity until after his formal reception
at court, the General, during the two months of his stay, except
the last five days, “lived very quietly.” Those who saw him
praised him as “well behaved, sedate and modest.” In his train
was Rudolph Kreutzer, the great violinist.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Bernadotte and the Heroic Symphony</span></div>

<p>Bernadotte had now just entered his 34th year; Kreutzer was
in his 32nd; both of them, therefore, in age, as in tastes and acquirements,
fitted to appreciate the splendor of Beethoven’s genius
and to enjoy his society. Moreover, as the Ambassador was
the son of a provincial advocate, there was no difference of rank
by birth, which could prevent them from meeting upon equal terms.
Under such circumstances, and remembering that just at that
epoch the young General Bonaparte was the topic of universal
wonder and admiration, one is fully prepared for the statement of
Schindler upon the origin of the “Heroic” Symphony:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The first idea for the symphony is said to have gone out from
General Bernadotte, then French Ambassador in Vienna, who esteemed
Beethoven very highly. This I heard from several of Beethoven’s
friends. I was also told so by Count Moritz Lichnowsky (brother of
Prince Lichnowsky), who was often in the society of Bernadotte with
Beethoven....</p></div>

<p>Again in 1823:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Beethoven had a lively recollection that Bernadotte had really
first inspired him with the idea of the “Eroica” Symphony.</p></div>

<p>This is from Schindler’s work in its first form. His unfortunate
propensity sometimes to accept the illusions of his fancy for
matters of fact is exhibited in the corresponding passage in his
third edition:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In Bernadotte’s salon, which was open to notabilities of all ranks
of life, Beethoven also appeared. He had already made it known that
he was a great admirer of the First Consul of the Republic. From the
General emanated the suggestion that Beethoven celebrate the greatest
hero of his age in a musical composition. It was not long (!) before the
thought had become a deed. (Vol. I, page 101.)</p></div>

<p>In proceeding with the history of the Symphony, Schindler
extracts largely from Beethoven’s own copy of Schleiermacher’s
translation of Plato. That the idea of Bonaparte as First Consul<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
may have influenced the form and matter of the Symphony, when
he came to the labor of its composition, and that Beethoven may
have based for himself a sort of system of political ethics upon
Schleiermacher’s Plato&mdash;all this is very possible; but Bernadotte
was far away from Vienna before the consular form of government
was adopted at Paris, and the “Sinfonia Eroica” had been publicly
performed at Vienna before the Plato came from the Berlin
press!</p>

<p>It is certainly to be regretted that so much fine writing by
Schindler and his copyists on this point should be exploded by a
date&mdash;like a ship by a single shell; but how could anyone believe
that the much-employed Beethoven, at the age of 27, he who had
refused two years before, even despite Wegeler’s urging, to listen
to a single private lecture on Kant, had become in so short a time
a Platonic philosopher?</p>

<p>Let us return to a field where Beethoven was even now more
at home than he ever became in Plato’s political philosophy.
Salieri had again engaged him for the “Widows and Orphans”
concerts of April 1st and 2nd at which Haydn’s “Seven Last Words”
was sung and Beethoven’s Pianoforte Quintet played. Kaiser
Franz and the imperial family were present.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Rivalry of Beethoven and Wölffl</span></div>

<p>It was now no longer the case that Beethoven was without a
rival as pianoforte virtuoso. He had a competitor fully worthy of
his powers; one who divided about equally with him the suffrages
of the leaders in the Vienna musical circles. In fact the excellencies
peculiar to the two were such and so different, that it depended
upon the taste of the auditor to which he accorded the praise of
superiority. Joseph Wölffl of Salzburg, two years younger than
Beethoven, a “wonder-child,” who had played a violin concerto
in public at the age of seven years, was a pupil of Leopold Mozart
and Michael Haydn. Being in Vienna, when but eighteen years
old, he was engaged, on the recommendation of Mozart, by the
Polish count Oginsky, who took him to Warsaw. His success
there, as pianoforte virtuoso, teacher and composer, was almost
unexampled. But it is only in his character as pianist that we
have to do with him; and a reference may be made to the general
principle, that a worthy competition is the best spur to genius.
When we read in one of his letters Beethoven’s words “I have also
greatly perfected my pianoforte playing,” they will cause no surprise;
for only by severe industry and consequent improvement
could he retain his high position, in the presence of such rivals as
Wölffl and, a year or two later, J. B. Cramer. A lively picture of
Wölffl by Tomaschek, who heard him in 1799, in his autobiography<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
sufficiently proves that his party in Vienna was composed of those
to whom extraordinary execution was the main thing; while Beethoven’s
admirers were of those who had hearts to be touched. A
parallel between Beethoven and Wölffl in a letter to the “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Allgemeine
Musikalische Zeitung</span>” (Vol. I, pp. 24, 25) dated April 22, 1799, just
at the time when the performances of both were topics of general
conversation in musical circles, and still fresh in the memory of
all who had heard them, is in the highest degree apposite to the
subject of this chapter. The writer says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Opinion is divided here touching the merits of the two; yet it
would seem as if the majority were on the side of the latter (Wölffl).
I shall try to set forth the peculiarities of each without taking part in
the controversy. Beethoven’s playing is extremely brilliant but has
less delicacy and occasionally he is guilty of indistinctness. He shows
himself to the greatest advantage in improvisation, and here, indeed,
it is most extraordinary with what lightness and yet firmness in the
succession of ideas Beethoven not only varies a theme given him on
the spur of the moment by figuration (with which many a virtuoso makes
his fortune and&mdash;wind) but really develops it. Since the death of
Mozart, who in this respect is for me still the <i>non plus ultra</i>, I have
never enjoyed this kind of pleasure in the degree in which it is provided
by Beethoven. In this Wölffl fails to reach him. But W. has advantages
in this that, sound in musical learning and dignified in his compositions,
he plays passages which seem impossible with an ease, precision
and clearness which cause amazement (of course he is helped here by
the large structure of his hands) and that his interpretation is always,
especially in Adagios, so pleasing and insinuating that one can not
only admire it but also enjoy.... That Wölffl likewise enjoys an
advantage because of his amiable bearing, contrasted with the somewhat
haughty pose of Beethoven, is very natural.</p></div>

<p>No biography of Beethoven which makes any pretence to
completeness, can omit the somewhat inflated and bombastic
account which Seyfried gives of the emulation between Beethoven
and Wölffl. Ignatz von Seyfried at the period in question was one
of Schikaneder’s conductors, to which position he had been called
when not quite twenty-one years of age, and had assumed its
duties March 1, 1797. He was among the most promising of the
young composers of the capital, belonged to a highly respectable
family, had been educated at the University, and his personal character
was unblemished. He would, therefore, naturally have access
to the musical salons and his reminiscences of music and musicians
in those years may be accepted as the records of observation. The
unfavorable light which the researches of Nottebohm have thrown
upon him as editor of the so-called “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Beethoven Studien</span>” does not
extend to such statements of fact as might easily have come under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
his own cognizance; and the passage now cited from the appendix
of the “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Studien</span>,” though written thirty years after the events it
describes, bears all the marks of being a faithful transcript of the
writer’s own memories:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Beethoven had already attracted attention to himself by several
compositions and was rated a first-class pianist in Vienna when he was
confronted by a rival in the closing years of the last century. Thereupon
there was, in a way, a revival of the old Parisian feud of the Gluckists
and Piccinists, and the many friends of art in the Imperial City arrayed
themselves in two parties. At the head of Beethoven’s admirers stood
the amiable Prince Lichnowsky; among the most zealous patrons of
Wölffl was the broadly cultured Baron Raymond von Wetzlar, whose
delightful villa (on the Grünberg near the Emperor’s recreation-castle)
offered to all artists, native and foreign, an asylum in the summer months,
as pleasing as it was desirable, with true British loyalty. There the
interesting combats of the two athletes not infrequently offered an
indescribable artistic treat to the numerous and thoroughly select gathering.
Each brought forward the latest product of his mind. Now
one and anon the other gave free rein to his glowing fancy; sometimes
they would seat themselves at two pianofortes and improvise alternately
on themes which they gave each other, and thus created many a four-hand
Capriccio which if it could have been put upon paper at the moment
would surely have bidden defiance to time. It would have been difficult,
perhaps impossible, to award the palm of victory to either one of the
gladiators in respect of technical skill. Nature had been a particularly
kind mother to Wölffl in bestowing upon him a gigantic hand which
could span a tenth as easily as other hands compass an octave, and
permitted him to play passages of double notes in these intervals with
the rapidity of lightning. In his improvisations even then Beethoven
did not deny his tendency toward the mysterious and gloomy. When
once he began to revel in the infinite world of tones, he was transported
also above all earthly things;&mdash;his spirit had burst all restricting
bonds, shaken off the yoke of servitude, and soared triumphantly and
jubilantly into the luminous spaces of the higher æther. Now his
playing tore along like a wildly foaming cataract, and the conjurer
constrained his instrument to an utterance so forceful that the stoutest
structure was scarcely able to withstand it; and anon he sank down,
exhausted, exhaling gentle plaints, dissolving in melancholy. Again
the spirit would soar aloft, triumphing over transitory terrestrial sufferings,
turn its glance upward in reverent sounds and find rest and comfort
on the innocent bosom of holy nature. But who shall sound the
depths of the sea? It was the mystical Sanscrit language whose hieroglyphs
can be read only by the initiated. Wölffl, on the contrary,
trained in the school of Mozart, was always equable; never superficial
but always clear and thus more accessible to the multitude. He used
art only as a means to an end, never to exhibit his acquirements. He
always enlisted the interest of his hearers and inevitably compelled
them to follow the progression of his well-ordered ideas. Whoever has
heard Hummel will know what is meant by this....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span></p>

<p>But for this (the attitude of their patrons) the <i>protégés</i> cared very
little. They respected each other because they knew best how to appreciate
each other, and as straightforward honest Germans followed the
principle that the roadway of art is broad enough for many, and that
it is not necessary to lose one’s self in envy in pushing forward for the
goal of fame!</p></div>

<p>Wölffl proved his respect for his rival by dedicating to “M. L.
van Beethoven” the pianoforte sonatas, Op.&nbsp;7, which were highly
commended in the “Allg. Mus. Zeit.” of Leipsic of January, 1799.
Another interesting and valuable discussion of Beethoven’s powers
and characteristics as a pianoforte virtuoso at this period is contained
in the autobiography of Tomaschek, who heard him both in
public and in private during a visit which Beethoven made again
this year to Prague. Tomaschek was then both in age (he was
born on April 17, 1774) and in musical culture competent to form
an independent judgment on such a subject.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Tomaschek on Beethoven’s Playing</span></div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In the year 1798, says Tomaschek (unfortunately without giving any
clue to the time of the year), in which I continued my juridical studies,
Beethoven, the giant among pianoforte players, came to Prague. He
gave a largely attended concert in the Konviktssaal, at which he played
his Concerto in C major, Op.&nbsp;15, and the Adagio and graceful Rondo
in A major from Op.&nbsp;2, and concluded with an improvisation on a theme
given him by Countess Sch... (Schick?), “<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Ah tu fosti il primo oggetto</span>,”
from Mozart’s “Titus” (duet No. 7). Beethoven’s magnificent playing
and particularly the daring flights in his improvisation stirred me
strangely to the depths of my soul; indeed I found myself so profoundly
bowed down that I did not touch my pianoforte for several days....
I heard Beethoven at his second concert, which neither in performance
nor in composition renewed again the first powerful impression. This
time he played the Concerto in B-flat which he had just composed in
Prague.<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> Then I heard him a third time at the home of Count C., where
he played, besides the graceful Rondo from the A major Sonata, an
improvisation on the theme: “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Ah! vous dirai-je, Maman</span>.” This time I
listened to Beethoven’s artistic work with more composure. I admired
his powerful and brilliant playing, but his frequent daring deviations
from one motive to another, whereby the organic connection, the
gradual development of idea was put aside, did not escape me. Evils
of this nature frequently weaken his greatest compositions, those which
sprang from a too exuberant conception. It is not seldom that the
unbiassed listener is rudely awakened from his transport. The singular
and original seemed to be his chief aim in composition, as is confirmed
by the answer which he made to a lady who asked him if he often
attended Mozart’s operas. “I do not know them,” he replied, “and do
not care to hear the music of others lest I forfeit some of my originality.”</p></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span></p>
<p>The veteran Tomaschek when he wrote thus had heard all the
greatest virtuosos of the pianoforte, who, from the days of Mozart
to 1840, had made themselves famous; and yet Beethoven remained
for him still “the lord of pianoforte players” and “the
giant among pianoforte players.” Still, great as he was now when
Tomaschek heard him, Beethoven could write three years later that
he had greatly perfected his playing.</p>

<p>It is only to be added to the history of the year 1798, that it is
the time in which Beethoven fixes the beginning of his deafness.
Like it, the year 1799 offers, upon the whole, but scanty materials
to the biographers of Beethoven&mdash;standing in broad contrast to
the next and, indeed all succeeding years, in which their quantity
and variety become a source of embarrassment.</p>

<p>Two new and valuable, though but passing acquaintances, were
made by Beethoven this year, however&mdash;with Domenico Dragonetti,
the greatest contrabassist known to history, and John Baptist
Cramer, one of the greatest pianists. Dragonetti was not more
remarkable for his astounding execution than for the deep, genuine
musical feeling which elevated and ennobled it. He was now&mdash;the
spring of 1799, so far as the means are at hand of determining
the time&mdash;returning to London from a visit to his native province,
and his route taking him to Vienna he remained there for several
weeks. Beethoven and he soon met and they were mutually
pleased with each other. Many years afterwards Dragonetti related
the following anecdote to Samuel Appleby, Esq., of Brighton,
England: “Beethoven had been told that his new friend could execute
violoncello music upon his huge instrument, and one morning,
when Dragonetti called at his room, he expressed his desire to hear
a sonata. The contrabass was sent for, and the Sonata, No. 2,
of Op.&nbsp;5, was selected. Beethoven played his part, with his eyes
immovably fixed upon his companion, and, in the finale, where the
arpeggios occur, was so delighted and excited that at the close he
sprang up and threw his arms around both player and instrument.”
The unlucky contrabassists of orchestras had frequent occasion
during the next few years to know that this new revelation of the
powers and possibilities of their instrument to Beethoven, was not
forgotten.</p>

<p>Cramer, born at Mannheim, 1771, but from early infancy
reared and educated in England, was successively the pupil of the
noted Bensor, Schroeter and Clementi; but, like Beethoven, was
in no small degree self-taught. He was so rarely and at such long
intervals on the Continent that his extraordinary merits have never
been fully understood and appreciated there. Yet for a period of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
many years in the first part of the nineteenth century he was undoubtedly,
upon the whole, the first pianist of Europe, The object
of his tour in 1799 was not to display his own talents and acquirements,
but to add to his general musical culture and to profit by
his observations upon the styles and peculiar characteristics of the
great pianists of the Continent. In Vienna he renewed his intercourse
with Haydn, whose prime favorite he had been in England,
and at once became extremely intimate with Beethoven.</p>

<p>Cramer surpassed Beethoven in the perfect neatness, correctness
and finish of his execution; Beethoven assured him that he
preferred his touch to that of any other player; his brilliancy was
astonishing; but yet taste, feeling, expression, were the qualities
which more eminently distinguished him. Beethoven stood far
above Cramer in power and energy, especially when extemporizing.
Each was supreme in his own sphere; each found much to learn in
the perfections of the other; each, in later years, did full justice to
the other’s powers. Thus Ries says: “Amongst the pianoforte
players he [Beethoven] had praise for but one as being distinguished&mdash;John
Cramer. All others were but little to him.” On
the other hand, Mr. Appleby, who knew Cramer well, was long
afterwards told by him, “No man in these days has heard
extempore playing, unless he has heard Beethoven.”</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Cramer’s Recollections of Beethoven</span></div>

<p>Making a visit one morning to him, Cramer, as he entered the
anteroom, heard Beethoven extemporizing by himself, and remained
there more than half an hour “completely entranced,”
never in his life having heard such exquisite effects, such
beautiful combinations. Knowing Beethoven’s extreme dislike
to being listened to on such occasions, Cramer retired and never
let him know that he had so heard him.</p>

<p>Cramer’s widow communicates a pleasant anecdote. At an
Augarten Concert the two pianists were walking together and hearing
a performance of Mozart’s pianoforte Concerto in C minor
(Köchel, No. 491); Beethoven suddenly stood still and, directing
his companion’s attention to the exceedingly simple, but equally
beautiful motive which is first introduced towards the end of the
piece, exclaimed: “Cramer, Cramer! we shall never be able to do
anything like that!” As the theme was repeated and wrought up
to the climax, Beethoven, swaying his body to and fro, marked
the time and in every possible manner manifested a delight rising
to enthusiasm.</p>

<p>Schindler’s record of his conversations upon Beethoven with
Cramer and Cherubini in 1841 is interesting and valuable. He
has, however, left one important consideration unnoticed, namely,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
that the visits of those masters to Vienna were five years
apart&mdash;five years of great change in Beethoven&mdash;a period during
which his deafness, too slight to attract Cramer’s attention, had
increased to a degree beyond concealment, and which, joined to his
increased devotion to composition and compulsory abandonment
of all ambition as a virtuoso, with consequent neglect of practice,
had affected his execution unfavorably. Hence the difference in
the opinions of such competent judges as Cramer, describing him
as he was in 1799-1800, Cherubini in 1805-6, and two years later
Clementi, afford a doubtless just and fair indication of the decline
of Beethoven’s powers as a mere pianist&mdash;not extending, however,
at least for some years yet, to his extemporaneous performances.
We shall find from Ries and others ample confirmation of the fact.</p>

<p>And now let Schindler speak:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>To the warm feeling of Cramer for Beethoven I owe the more
important matters.... Cherubini, disposed to be curt, characterized
Beethoven’s pianoforte playing in a single word: “rough.” The gentleman
Cramer, however, desired that less offence be taken at the rudeness
of his performance than at the unreliable reading of one and the same
composition&mdash;one day intellectually brilliant and full of characteristic
expression, the next freakish to the verge of unclearness; often confused.
(Which is confirmed by Ries, Czerny and others.) Because of this a
few friends expressed a wish to hear Cramer play several works publicly
from the manuscript. This touched a sensitive spot in Beethoven;
his jealousy was aroused and, according to Cramer, their relations became
strained.</p></div>

<p>This strain, however, left no such sting behind it as to diminish
Cramer’s good opinion of Beethoven both as man and artist, or
hinder his free expression of it. To this fact the concurrent testimony
of his widow and son, and those enthusiasts for Beethoven
Charles Neate, Cipriani Potter and others who knew Cramer well,
bear witness. It was the conversation of Cramer about Beethoven
which induced Potter, after the fall of Napoleon, to journey to
Vienna, to make the acquaintance of the great master and, if
possible, become his pupil.</p>

<p>Cramer’s musical gods were Handel and Mozart, notwithstanding
his life-long love for Bach’s clavier compositions; hence
the abrupt transitions, the strange modulations, and the, until
then, unheard passages, which Beethoven introduced ever more
freely into his works&mdash;many of which have not yet found universal
acceptance&mdash;were to him, as to Tomaschek and so many other of
his contemporaries, imperfections and distortions of compositions,
which but for them were models of beauty and harmonious proportion.
He once gave this feeling utterance with comic exaggeration,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
when Potter, then a youth, was extolling some abstruse combinations,
by saying: “If Beethoven emptied his inkstand upon a piece
of music paper you would admire it!”</p>

<p>Upon Beethoven’s demeanor in society, Schindler proceeds
thus:</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Beethoven’s Demeanor in Society</span></div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The communications of both (Cramer and Madame Cherubini)
agreed in saying that in mixed society his conduct was reserved, stiff
and marked by artist’s pride; whereas among his intimates he was droll,
lively, indeed, voluble at times, and fond of giving play to all the arts
of wit and sarcasm, not always wisely especially in respect of political
and social prejudices. To this the two were able to add much concerning
his awkwardness in taking hold of such objects as glasses, coffee cups,
etc., to which Master Cherubini added the comment: “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Toujours
brusque</span>.” These statements confirmed what I had heard from his older
friends touching the social demeanor of Beethoven in general.</p></div>

<p>Cramer reached Vienna early in September, and remained
there, according to Schindler, through the following winter; but
he does not appear to have given any public concerts, although,
during the first month of his stay, we learn from a newspaper, he
“earned general and deserved applause by his playing.” It is
needless to dwell upon the advantages to Beethoven of constant
intercourse for several months with a master like Cramer, whose
noblest characteristics as pianist were the same as Mozart’s, and
precisely those in which Beethoven was deficient.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Let us pass in review the compositions which had their origin
in the years 1798 and 1799. First of all come the three Trios for
stringed instruments, Op.&nbsp;9. The exact date of their conception
has not yet been determined, all that is positive being that Beethoven
sold them to Traeg on March 16, 1798, and that the publisher’s
announcement of them appeared on July 21st of the same
year. The only sketches for the Trios quoted by Nottebohm show
them in connection with a sketch for the last movement of the
“<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Sonate pathétique</span>,” which was published in 1799; but this proves
nothing. It may be easily imagined that Beethoven desired to
make more extended use of the experience gained in writing the
Trios, Op.&nbsp;3, and that he therefore began sketching Op.&nbsp;9 in 1796
or 1797. Beethoven dedicated the works to Count Browne in
words such as could hardly have been called forth by the present
of a horse. Perhaps some future investigator will be able to show
upon what grounds Beethoven in the dedication called Count<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
Browne his “first Mæcenas,” a title better deserved by Prince
Lichnowsky.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">The First Two Pianoforte Concertos</span></div>

<p>The first two concertos for pianoforte call for consideration
here, for it was not until 1798 that they acquired the form in which
they are now known. That the Concerto in B-flat was the earlier
of the two has been proved in a preceding chapter of this volume.
It was this Concerto and not the one in C major (as Wegeler incorrectly
reported) that was played in March, 1795. Wegeler’s error
was due to the circumstance that the Concerto in C was published
first. Sketches for the Concerto in B-flat major are found among
the exercises written for Albrechtsberger, sketches for the Sonata
in E major (Op.&nbsp;14, No. 1), and others for a little quartet movement
which was owned by M. Malherbe of Paris; on this sheet occurs
a short exercise with the remark “<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Contrapunto all’ottava</span>” which
points to the beginning of 1795 or even 1794. The sketch is an
obviously early form of a passage in the free fantasia. This agrees
with the statement that on March 29, 1795, Beethoven played a
new concerto, the key of which is not indicated. It is most likely
that it was this in B-flat, since the one in C did not exist at the
time. Beethoven, it appears, played it a few times afterward in
Vienna and then rewrote it. According to Tomaschek’s account
he played the B-flat Concerto (expressly distinguished from that in
C) in 1798, again in Prague. Tomaschek added, “which he had
composed in Prague.” This is confounding the original version
with the revision, concerning which Nottebohm gives information
in his “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Zweite Beethoveniana</span>” on the basis of sketches which
point to 1798. The fact of the revision is proved by Beethoven’s
memoranda, such as “To remain as it was,” “From here on everything
to remain as it was.” The revision of the first movement was
radical, and the entire work was apparently undertaken in view of
an imminent performance, most likely that of Prague in 1798.
It was published by Hoffmeister und Kühnel and dedicated to
Carl Nikl Edlen von Nikelsberg.</p>

<p>That the Concerto in C was composed later than that in B-flat
has been proved by Beethoven’s testimony as well as other external
evidences and is confirmed by the few remaining sketches analyzed
by Nottebohm. They appear in connection with a sketch for the
cadenza for the B-flat Concerto which, therefore, must have been
finished when its companion was begun. A sketch for a cadenza
for the C major Concerto comes after sketches for the Sonata in
D, Op.&nbsp;10, No. 3, which was published in 1798. This new concerto
must, therefore, have been finished. According to the testimony
of Tomaschek he played it in 1798 in the Konviktsaal in Prague.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
Schindler says he played it for the first time “in the spring of 1800
in the Kärnthnerthor-Theater,” but this concert is likely to have
been that of April 2nd, 1800, described by Hanslick in his “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Geschichte
des Concertwesens in Wien</span>” (p. 127). Schindler evidently
knew nothing of the performance in Prague and a confusion must
be at the bottom of Czerny’s statement that the Concerto was
played in the Kärnthnerthor-Theater in 1801. The Concerto in
C, dedicated to the Countess Odescalchi, <i>née</i> Keglevich, was published
by Mollo in Vienna in 1801. There are three cadenzas for
the first movement of the Concerto, the last two of which call for
an extended compass of the pianoforte and are thus shown to be
of later date than the first.</p>

<p>To these concertos must be added the Rondo in B-flat for
Pianoforte and Orchestra found unfinished among Beethoven’s
compositions and published by Diabelli and Co. in 1829. Sonnleithner,
on the authority of Diabelli, says it was completed by
Czerny, who also filled out the accompaniment. There is no
authentic record of the time of its composition. O. Jahn surmised
that it may have been designed for the Concerto in B-flat. Its
contents indicate an earlier period. A sketch printed by Nottebohm
associated with a Romanza for Pianoforte, Flute and Bassoon,
judged by the handwriting, is not of later date than 1795.
E. Mandyczewski compared the original manuscript, now in the
library of the <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Gesellschaft der Musikfreunde</span>, with the printed form
and decided that the work was completed in plan and <i>motiri</i> by
Beethoven, who, however, did not carry out the cadenzas and only
indicated the passages. The share which Czerny had in it is thus
indicated; he added the cadenzas and extended the pianoforte
passages which Beethoven had only indicated, making them more
effective and brilliant. The use of the high registers of the pianoforte
which Czerny employs somewhat too freely in view of the
simple character of the piece, was not contemplated by Beethoven,
who once remarked of Czerny: “He uses the piccolo too much for
me.” In Mandyczewski’s opinion the handwriting points to a
time before 1800, and the contents indicate the early Vienna if not
the Bonn period. Mandyczewski also thinks that the romanza-like
Andante is palpably a very early composition and that the
correspondence in key and measure with the B-flat Concerto might
indicate that it was originally designed as a part of that work, a supposition
which is strengthened by the fact that the original manuscript
is neither dated nor signed. This internal evidence has much
in its favor, the more since it is not at all obvious what might have
prompted Beethoven to write an independent rondo for concert<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
use. There is no external evidence; if there were, the conception
of the B-flat Concerto would have to be set at a much earlier
date than has yet been done. The first Vienna sketches for the
Concerto, as Nottebohm shows, prove that the present three movements
belonged together from the beginning. They were, therefore,
surely played at the first performance in 1795. Nottebohm,
who repeated Jahn’s surmise in his “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Thematisches Verzeichniss</span>,”
changed his mind after a study of the sketches and rejected the
notion that the rondo had been designed for the Concerto. Only
by assuming an earlier date for the rondo can the theory be upheld.
Attention may here be called to Wegeler’s statement (“<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Notizen</span>,”
p. 56) that the rondo of the first Concerto (he says, of course, the
Concerto in C) was not composed until the second afternoon before
the performance. There may possibly have been another. This
is not necessarily disproved by the fact that sketches for the present
one were in existence. The question is not settled by the evidence
now before us, but the probabilities are with Mandyczewski.</p>

<p>Now begins the glorious series of sonatas. The first were the
three (Op.&nbsp;10) which, though begun in part at an earlier date, were
definitively finished and published in 1798. Eder, the publisher,
opened a subscription for them by an advertisement in the “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Wiener
Zeitung</span>,” July 5th, 1798; therefore they were finished at that
time. The sketching for them had begun in 1796, as appears from
Nottebohm’s statement,<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> and Beethoven worked on the three
simultaneously. Sketches for the first movement of the first Sonata
are mixed with sketches for the soprano air for Umlauf’s “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Schusterin</span>”
which have been attributed to 1796, and the Variations for three
Wind-Instruments which were played in 1797. Sketches for the
third sonata are found among notes for the Sextet for Wind-Instruments
(composed about 1796) and also for the Concerto in C minor,
which, therefore, was begun thus early, and for one of the seven
country dances which appeared in 1799, or perhaps earlier. The
sketches for the last movement of No. 3 are associated alone with
sketches for a cadenza for the C major Concerto which Beethoven
played in Prague in 1798, and may therefore be placed in this
year. It follows that the three sonatas were developed gradually
in 1796-98, and completed in 1798. From the sketches and the
accompanying memoranda<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> we learn, furthermore, that for the first
Sonata, which now has three movements, a fourth, an Intermezzo,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
was planned on which Beethoven several times made a beginning
but permitted to fall. Two of these movements became known
afterwards as “Bagatelles.” We learn also that the last movement
of the first Sonata, and the second movement of the second, were
originally laid out on a larger scale.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Composition of the “Sonate Pathétique”</span></div>

<p>The “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Sonate pathétique</span>,” Op.&nbsp;13, was published by Eder, in
Vienna, in 1799, and afterwards by Hoffmeister, who announced
them on December 18 of the same year. Sketches for the rondo
are found among those for the Trio, Op.&nbsp;9, and after the beginning
of a fair copy of the Sonata, Op.&nbsp;49, No. 1. From this there is no
larger deduction than that the Sonata probably had its origin
about 1798. One of the sketches, however, indicates that the last
movement was originally conceived for more than one instrument,
probably for a sonata for pianoforte and violin. Beethoven published
the two Sonatas, Op.&nbsp;14, which he dedicated to the Baroness
Braun, immediately after the “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Sonate pathétique</span>.” They came
from the press of Mollo and were announced on December 21,
1799. The exact time of their composition cannot be determined
definitely. Up to the present time no sketches for the second are
known to exist; copious ones for the first, however, are published
by Nottebohm in his “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Zweite Beethoveniana</span>” (p. 45 <i>et seq.</i>), some
of which appear before sketches for the Sonata, Op.&nbsp;12, No. 3, then
approaching completion, and some after sketches for the Concerto
in B-flat. Because of this juxtaposition, Nottebohm places the
conception of the Sonata in 1795.</p>

<p>Touching the history of the Trio, Op.&nbsp;11, for Pianoforte,
Clarinet and Violoncello, little is known. It was advertised as
wholly new by Mollo and Co. on October 3, 1798, and is inscribed
to the Countess Thun. Sketches associated with works that are
unknown or were never completed are in the British Museum and
set forth by Nottebohm in his “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Zweite Beethoveniana</span>” (p.
515). The sketch for the Adagio resembles the beginning of the
minuet in the Sonata, Op.&nbsp;49, No. 2, and is changed later; this
points approximately to 1798. The last movement consists of a
series of variations on the theme of a trio from Weigl’s opera
“<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">L’Amor marinaro</span>,” beginning “<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Pria ch’io l’impegno</span>.” Weigl’s
opera was performed for the first time on October 15, 1797.
Czerny told Otto Jahn that Beethoven took the theme at the request
of a clarinet player (Beer?) for whom he wrote the Trio.
The elder Artaria told Cipriani Potter in 1797, that he had given
the theme to Beethoven and requested him to introduce variations
on it into a trio, and added that Beethoven did not know that the
melody was Weigl’s until after the Trio was finished, whereupon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
he grew very angry on finding it out. Czerny says in the supplement
to his “Pianoforte School”:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>It was at the wish of the clarinet player for whom Beethoven
wrote this Trio that he employed the above theme by Weigl (which was
then very popular) as the finale. At a later period he frequently contemplated
writing another concluding movement for this Trio, and letting
the variations stand as a separate work.</p></div>

<p>If Czerny is correct in his statement, obvious deductions from
it are these, which are scarcely consistent with Artaria’s story: if
the theme was “very popular” at the time the opera must have
had several performances, and it is not likely that the melody was
unfamiliar to Beethoven, who also, it may be assumed, wrote the
title of Weigl’s trio, which is printed at the beginning of the last
movement of Beethoven’s composition. Beethoven produced the
Trio for the first time at the house of Count Fries on the occasion
of his first meeting with Steibelt. The three Sonatas for Pianoforte
and Violin, Op.&nbsp;12, were advertised in the “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Wiener Zeitung</span>” of
January 12, 1799, as published by Artaria, which would seem to
place their origin in 1798. The program of a concert given by
Madame Duschek on March 29, 1798, preserved in the archives of
the <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Gesellschaft der Musikfreunde</span>, announces a sonata with accompaniment
to be played by Beethoven. The accompanying (<i>obbligato</i>)
instrument is not mentioned, but the work may well have
been one of these Sonatas. Nottebohm discusses the juxtaposition
of sketches for the second Sonata with sketches for the Pianoforte
Concerto in B-flat and the sonata in E, Op.&nbsp;14, No. 1, and is inclined
to fix 1795 as the year of the sonata’s origin. But we are in
the dark as to whether the sketches for the Pianoforte Concerto
were for its original or its revised form.</p>

<p>Among the instrumental compositions of this year belong
the Variations for Pianoforte and Violoncello on “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Ein Mädchen
oder Weibchen</span>” from Mozart’s “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Zauberflöte</span>,” of which nothing
more is known than that Traeg announced their publication on
September 12, 1798. They were afterward taken over by Artaria.
The Variation for Pianoforte on a theme from Grétry’s “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Richard,
Cœur de Lion</span>” (“<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Une fièvre brûlante</span>”) were announced as newly
published on November 7, 1798, by Traeg; Cappi and Diabelli
acquired them later. Sketches for them are found by the side
of sketches for the first movement of the Sonata in C minor,
Op.&nbsp;10, No. 1, which circumstance indicates that 1796 was
the year of their origin. According to Sonnleithner, “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Richard,
Cœur de Lion</span>” was first performed at the Hoftheater, Vienna, on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
January 7, 1788; then again on June 13, 1799 in the Theater auf
den Wieden; but a ballet, “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Richard Löwenherz</span>,” by Vigano, music
by Weigl, in which Grétry’s romance, “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Une fièvre brûlante</span>,” was
interpolated, was brought forward on July 2, 1795, in the Hof- und
Nationaltheater and repeated often in that year, and it was thence,
no doubt, that the suggestion for the variations came to Beethoven.
The six little Variations on a Swiss air were published,
according to Nottebohm, by Simrock in Bonn in 1798. The ten
Variations on “<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">La stessa, la stessissima</span>” from Salieri’s “Falstaff,
ossia le tre Burle,” were announced as just published in the
“<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Wiener Zeitung</span>” of March 2, 1799. Salieri’s opera was performed
on January 3 (Wlassak says January 6), 1799, in the Hoftheater;
Beethoven’s, therefore, was an occasional composition conceived
and produced in a very short time. Sketches are found among
some for the first Quartet, Op.&nbsp;18, and others. The Variations
are dedicated to the Countess Babette Keglevich. Twice more in
the same year operatic productions induced similar works. The
publication of the Variations on “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Kind, willst du ruhig schlafen?</span>”
from Winter’s “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Unterbrochenes Opferfest</span>,” was announced in the
“<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Wiener Zeitung</span>” of December 21, 1799, by Mollo and Co.; the
opera had its first performance in Vienna on June 15, 1796, and was
repeated frequently within the years immediately following&mdash;six
times in 1799. In this case also it may be assumed that publication
followed hard on the heels of composition. Sketches are found
in companionship with others belonging to the Quartet, Op.&nbsp;18, No.
5, and the Septet. The Variations on “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Tändeln und Scherzen</span>,” from
Süssmayr’s opera “Soliman II, oder die drei Sultaninnen,” belong
to the same time. The opera was performed on October 1, 1799,
in the Hoftheater; the publication of the variations by Hoffmeister
was announced in the “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Wiener Zeitung</span>” on December 18, 1799.
They may have been printed previously by Eder. They were dedicated
to Countess Browne, <i>née</i> von Bietinghoff. It is interesting
to learn from Czerny that these Variations were the first of Beethoven’s
compositions which the master gave him to study when
he became his pupil. Before them he had pieces by C. P. E. Bach
and after them the “Sonate pathéthique.”</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">The Period of the First Symphony</span></div>

<p>As evidence pointing to the period in which the first Symphony
was written we have, first of all, the report of the first performance
on April 2, 1800; but inasmuch as the copying of the parts and the
rehearsals must have consumed a considerable time, the period
would be much too short (especially in view of Beethoven’s method
of working) if we were also to assume that the Symphony originated
in 1800. It is very likely that, with the Quartets, it was sketched<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
at an earlier period and worked out in the main by 1799 at the
latest. It was published toward the end of 1801 by Hoffmeister
and Kühnel as Op.&nbsp;21, dedicated to Baron van Swieten and advertised
in the “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Wiener Zeitung</span>” of January 16, 1802. Beethoven
had already planned a symphony while studying with Albrechtsberger.
Nottebohm reports on his purposes after a study of some
sketches and from him we learn that the theme of the present last
movement was originally intended for a first movement. Beethoven
must have worked on this composition in 1794-’95, perhaps
at the suggestion of van Swieten&mdash;a conclusion suggested by the
fact that the dedication of the first symphony went to him. Beethoven
abandoned this early plan and turned to other ideas for the
new symphony, but there is no clue as to the precise time when
this was done. In 1802, Mollo published an arrangement of the
symphony as a quintet at the same time that Hoffmeister and
Kühnel published a like arrangement of the Septet. Beethoven
published the following protest in the “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Wiener Zeitung</span>” of October
20, 1802:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I believe that I owe it to the public and myself publicly to announce
that the two Quintets in C major and E-flat major, of which
the first (taken from a symphony of mine) has been published by Mr.
Mollo in Vienna, and the second (taken from my familiar Septet, Op.&nbsp;20)
by Mr. Hoffmeister in Leipzig, are not original quintets but transcriptions
prepared by the publishers. The making of transcriptions at the
best is a matter against which (in this prolific day of such things) an
author must protest in vain; but it is possible at least to demand of the
publishers that they indicate the fact on the title-page, so that the
honor of the author may not be lessened and the public be not deceived.
This much to hinder such things in the future. At the same
time I announce that a new Quintet of mine in C major, Op.&nbsp;29, will
shortly be published by Breitkopf and Härtel in Leipzig.</p></div>

<p>Mention may here be made in conclusion of the two French
songs, “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Que le temps (jour) me dure</span>” (Rousseau) and “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Plaisir
d’aimer</span>,” recovered from sketches and described by Jean Chantavoine
in “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Die Musik</span>” (Vol. I, No. 12, 1902). The origin of the
latter is fixed in 1799, by its association with a sketch for the
Quartets, Op.&nbsp;18.</p>

<h2>Chapter XVI</h2>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Beethoven’s Social Life in Vienna&mdash;His Friends: Vogl,
Kiesewetter, Zmeskall, Amenda, Count Lichnowsky, Eppinger,
Krumpholz&mdash;Schuppanzigh and His Quartet&mdash;Hummel&mdash;Friendships
with Women&mdash;His Dedications.</p></div>


<p>The chronological progress of the narrative must again be
interrupted for a chapter or two, since no picture of a man’s
life can be complete without the lights or shades arising
from his social relations&mdash;without some degree of knowledge
respecting those with whom he is on terms of equality and intimacy
and whose company he most affects. The attempt to draw such
a picture in the case of Beethoven, that is, during his first years in
Vienna, leaves much to be desired, for, although the search for
materials has not been very unsuccessful, many of the data are
but vague and scattered notices. In a Conversation Book, bearing
Beethoven’s own date “on the 20th of March, 1820,” some person
unknown writes:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Do you want to know where I first had the honor and good fortune
to see you? More than 25 years ago I lived with Frank of Prague in
the Drachengassel in the old Fish Market. Several noblemen, for
instance His Excellency van B. Cristen (?), Heinerle, Vogl (now a singer),
Kösswetter, basso, now Court Councillor, Greyenstein (?), has long been
living in France, etc. There we often</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="centerpara">
musicicised, etc.<br />
supperized, etc.<br />
punchized, etc.
</div></div>

<p>and at the conclusion Your Excellency often rejoiced us at <i>my</i> P. F.
I was then Court Councillor in the War Office (?). I have practised
since then at least 15 thousand métiers&mdash;Did we meet in Prague? In
what year?&mdash;1796&mdash;3 days&mdash;I was in Prague also in 1790-1-2.</p></div>

<p>There is nothing in the portions of this Conversation Book,
copied for this work, to show who this man of “15 thousand métiers”
was, now sitting with Beethoven in an eating-house, and recalling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
to his memory the frolics of his first year and a quarter in Vienna;
nor are Heinerle, Cristen, Greyenstein and Frank of Prague sufficiently
known to fame as to be now identified; but Johann Michael
Vogl, less than two years older than Beethoven, was afterward
a very celebrated tenor of the opera. In 1793-4 he was still pursuing
the study of jurisprudence, which he abandoned in 1795 for the
stage. May not this early friendship for Beethoven have been
among the causes of the resuscitation of “Fidelio” in 1814, for the
benefit performance of Vogl, Saal and Weinmüller?</p>

<p>There is a story, first put in circulation by a certain August
Barth, to the effect that the singer of that name once finding
Beethoven employed in burning a mass of musical and other papers,
sang one vocal piece thus destined to destruction, was pleased with
it, and saved the immortal “Adelaide!” The story is sufficiently
refuted by the fact that when Barth first came to Vienna, in 1807,
the “Adelaide” had been in print some ten years. If the name Vogl
be substituted in the tale, there may, perhaps, be so much truth
in it as this: that he was consulted upon the merits of the composition
by Beethoven, approved it, and first sang it and made it
known&mdash;as he was the first, years afterwards, to sing in public the
“Erlkönig” and other fine productions of Franz Schubert. The
“Kösswetter, basso,” was Raphael George Kiesewetter, who lived
to be renowned as a writer upon topics of musical history, and to
play a part in the revival of ancient music in Vienna, not less noteworthy
than that of Thibaut in Heidelberg. At the period of the
“music-making, supping and punch drinking” by the “noblemen”
in the apartments of Frank of Prague, Kiesewetter was a young
man of twenty, engaged, like Vogl, in the study of the law. In
the spring of 1794&mdash;and thus the date of these meetings is determined&mdash;he
received an appointment in the military chancellary,
and went at once to the headquarters at Schwetzingen on the Rhine.
More important and valuable during these years, as subsequently,
was the warm, sincere friendship of Nicolaus Zmeskall von Domanovecz,
an official in the Royal Hungarian Court Chancellary. “You
belong to my earliest friends in Vienna,” writes Beethoven in 1816.
Zmeskall, to quote the words of Sonnleithner,</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>was an expert violoncellist, a sound and tasteful composer. Too modest
to publish his compositions, he willed them to the archives of the Gesellschaft
der Musikfreunde. After personal examination I can only give
assurance that his three string quartets would entitle him to an honorable
place among masters of the second rank, and are more deserving to
be heard than many new things which, for all manner of reasons, we are
compelled to hear.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Beethoven’s Regard for Zmeskall</span></div>

<p>That Zmeskall was a very constant attendant at the musical
parties of Prince Carl Lichnowsky and frequently took part in
them, may be seen from Wegeler’s record. He was ten years older
than Beethoven, had been long enough in Vienna to know the best
society there, into which he was admitted not more because of his
musical attainments than because of the respectability of his position
and character; and was, therefore, what the young student-pianist
needed most, a friend, who at the same time could be to a
certain degree an authoritative adviser, and at all times was a judicious
one. On the part of Zmeskall there was an instant and hearty
appreciation of the extraordinary powers of the young stranger
from the Rhine and a clear anticipation of his splendid artistic
future. A singular proof of this is the care with which he preserved
the most insignificant scraps of paper, if Beethoven had written
a few words upon them; for, certainly, no other motive could have
induced him to save many notes of this kind and of no importance
ten, fifteen, twenty years, as may be seen in the published letters
of the composer. On the part of Beethoven, there was sincere
respect for the dignity and gravity of Zmeskall’s character, which
usually restrained him within proper limits in their personal intercourse;
but he delighted, especially in the earlier period, to give,
in his notes and letters, full play to his queer fancies and sometimes
extravagant humour.</p>

<p>Here are a few examples in point:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Had Zmeskall not carefully treasured these notes, they would
never have met any eye but his own; it is evident, therefore, that
he entered fully into their humor, and that it was the same to
him, whether he found himself addressed as “Baron,” “Count,”
“Cheapest Baron,” “Music Count,” “Baron Muckcartdriver,”
“His Zmeskallian Zmeskallity,” or simply “Dear Z.”&mdash;which last
is the more usual. He knew his man, and loved him; and these
“quips and quiddities” were received in the spirit which begat
them. The whole tenor of the correspondence between the two
shows that Zmeskall had more influence for good upon Beethoven
than any other of his friends; he could reprove him for faults,
and check him when in the wrong, without producing a quarrel
more serious than the one indicated in the protest, above given,
against interrupting his “good humor.”</p>

<p>As a musician, as well as man and friend, Zmeskall stood high
in Beethoven’s esteem. His apartments, No. 1166, in that huge
conglomeration of buildings known as the Bürgerspital, were for
a long series of years the scene of a private morning concert, to
which only the first performers of chamber music and a very
few guests were admitted. Here, after the rupture with Prince
Lichnowsky, Beethoven’s productions of this class were usually
first tried over. Not until Beethoven’s death did their correspondence
cease.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Esteem and Affection for Amenda</span></div>

<p>Another young man who gained an extraordinary place in
Beethoven’s esteem and affection, and who departed from Vienna<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
before anything occurred to cause a breach between them, was
a certain Karl Amenda, from the shore of the Baltic, who died some
forty years later as Provost in Courland. He was a good violinist,
belonged to the circle of dilettanti which Beethoven so much affected,
and, on parting, received from the composer one of his first attempts
at quartet composition. His name most naturally suggests itself
to fill the blank in a letter to Ries, July, 1804, wherein some living
person, not named, is mentioned as one with whom he (Beethoven)
“never had a misunderstanding,” but he adds “although
we have known nothing of each other for nearly six years,” which
was not true of Amenda, since letters passed between them in
1801. The small portion of their written correspondence which
has been made public shows that their friendship was of the romantic
character once so much the fashion; and a letter of Amenda
is filled with incense which in our day would bear the name of
almost too gross flattery. But times change and tastes with them.
His name appears once in the Zmeskall correspondence, namely, in
a mutilated note now in the Royal Imperial Court Library, beginning
“My cheapest Baron! Tell the guitarist to come to me to-day.
Amenda is to make an <i>Amende</i> (part torn away) which he deserves
for his bad pauses (torn) provide the guitarist.”</p>

<p>Karl Amenda was born on October 4, 1771, at Lippaiken in
Courland. He studied music with his father and Chapelmaster
Beichtmer, was so good a violinist that he was able to give a concert
at 14 years of age, and continued his musical studies after he
was matriculated as a student of theology at the University of
Jena. After a three years’ course there he set out on a tour, and
reached Vienna in the spring of 1798. There he first became precentor
for Prince Lobkowitz and afterward music-teacher in the
family of Mozart’s widow. How, thereupon, he became acquainted
with Beethoven we are able to report from a document still in
the possession of the family, which bears the superscription “Brief
Account of the Friendly Relations between L. v. Beethoven and
Karl Friedrich Amenda, afterward Provost at Talsen in Courland,
written down from oral tradition”:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>After the completion of his theological studies K. F. Amenda goes to
Vienna, where he several times meets Beethoven at the table d’hôte,
attempts to enter into conversation with him, but without success, since
Beeth. remains very <i>réservé</i>. After some time Amenda, who meanwhile
had become music-teacher at the home of Mozart’s widow, receives
an invitation from a friendly family and there plays first violin in a
quartet. While he was playing somebody turned the pages for him,
and when he turned about at the finish he was frightened to see Beethoven,
who had taken the trouble to do this and now withdrew with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
bow. The next day the extremely amiable host at the evening party
appeared and cried out: “What have you done? You have captured
Beethoven’s heart! B. requests that you rejoice him with your company.”
A., much pleased, hurries to B., who at once asks him to play with him.
This is done and when, after several hours, A. takes his leave, B. accompanies
him to his quarters, where there was music again. As B. finally prepared
to go he said to A.: “I suppose you can accompany me.” This
is done, and B. kept A. till evening and went with him to his home late
at night. From that time the mutual visits became more and more
numerous and the two took walks together, so that the people in the
streets when they saw only one of them in the street at once called out:
“Where is the other one?” A. also introduced Mylich, with whom he
had come to Vienna, to B., and Mylich often played trios with B. and A.
His instrument was the second violin or viola. Once when B. heard
that Mylich had a sister in Courland who played the pianoforte prettily,
he handed him a sonata in manuscript with the inscription: “To the
sister of my good friend Mylich.” The manuscript was rolled up and
tied with a little silk ribbon. B. complained that he could not get along
on the violin. Asked by A. to try it, nevertheless, he played so fearfully
that A. had to call out: “Have mercy&mdash;quit!” B. quit playing and
the two laughed till they had to hold their sides. One evening B. improvised
marvellously on the pianoforte and at the close A. said: “It is
a great pity that such glorious music is born and lost in a moment.”
Whereupon B.: “There you are mistaken; I can repeat every extemporization”;
whereupon he sat himself down and played it again without
a change. B. was frequently embarrassed for money. Once he complained
to A.; he had to pay rent and had no idea how he could do it.
“That’s easily remedied,” said A. and gave him a theme (“<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Freudvoll
und Leidvoll</span>”) and locked him in his room with the remark that he must
make a beginning on the variations within three hours. When A. returns
he finds B. on the spot but ill-tempered. To the question whether or
not he had begun B. handed over a paper with the remark: “There’s
your stuff!” (<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Da ist der Wisch!</i>) A. takes the notes joyfully to B.’s
landlord and tells him to take it to a publisher, who would pay him handsomely
for it. The landlord hesitated at first but finally decided to do
the errand and, returning joyfully, asks if other bits of paper like that
were to be had. But in order definitely to relieve such financial needs
A. advised B. to make a trip to Italy. B. says he is willing but only on
condition that A. go with him. A. agrees gladly and the trip is practically
planned. Unfortunately news of a death calls A. back to his home. His
brother has been killed in an accident and the duty of caring for the
family devolves on him. With doubly oppressed heart A. takes leave
of B. to return to his home in Courland. There he receives a letter
from B. saying: “Since you cannot go along, I shall not go to Italy.”
Later the friends frequently exchanged thoughts by correspondence.<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a></p></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span></p>
<p>Though, as we have learned, it was music which brought
Beethoven into contact with Amenda, it was the latter’s amiability
and nobility of character that endeared him to the composer, who
cherished him as one of his dearest friends and confided things to
him which he concealed from his other intimates&mdash;his deafness,
for instance. A striking proof of Beethoven’s affection is offered
by the fact that he gave Amenda a copy of his Quartet in F (Op.&nbsp;18,
No. 1), writing on the first violin part:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Dear Amenda: Take this quartet as a small memorial of our
friendship, and whenever you play it recall the days which we passed
together and the sincere affection felt for you then and which will always
be felt by</p>

<p class="sig">
Your true and warm friend<br />
Ludwig van Beethoven.</p>
<p class="date">
Vienna, 1799, June 25.</p></div>

<p>In a letter written nearly a year later Beethoven asks his
friend not to lend the quartet, as he had revised it. A letter
written, evidently, about the time of Amenda’s departure from
Vienna indicated that Beethoven was oppressed at this period with
another grief than that caused by the loss of his friend’s companionship.
Beethoven speaks of his “already lacerated heart,” says
that “the worst of the storm is over” and mentions an invitation
to Poland&mdash;which he had accepted. Nothing came of this Polish
enterprise. Dr. A. C. Kalischer suspected that the lacerated
heart was due to the composer’s unrequited love for Magdalena
Willmann, a singer then in Vienna to whom he made a proposal
of marriage which was never answered.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Friendship with Count Lichnowsky</span></div>

<p>Count Moritz Lichnowsky, brother of Prince Carl, of whom
we shall not lose sight entirely until the closing scene, was
another of the friends of those years. He had been a pupil of
Mozart, played the pianoforte with much skill and was an influential
member of the party which defended the novelty and felt the
grandeur of his friend’s compositions. Schindler saw much of him
during Beethoven’s last years, and eulogizes the “noble Count”
in very strong terms.</p>

<p>Another of that circle of young dilettanti, and one of the first
players of Beethoven’s compositions, was a young Jewish violinist,
Heinrich Eppinger. He played at a charity concert in Vienna,
making his first appearance there in 1789. “He became, in after
years,” says a correspondent of the time, “a dilettante of the most
excellent reputation, lived modestly on a small fortune and devoted
himself entirely to music.” At the period before us Eppinger
was one of Beethoven’s first violins at the private concerts of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
nobility. Häring, who became a distinguished merchant and
banker, belonged now to this circle of young amateur musicians,
and in 1795 had the reputation of being at the head of the amateur
violinists. The youthful friendship between him and the composer
was not interrupted as they advanced into life, and twenty
years later was of great advantage to Beethoven.</p>

<p>But a more interesting person for us is the instructor under
whom Beethoven in Vienna resumed his study of the violin (a
fact happily preserved by Ries)&mdash;Wenzel Krumpholz. He was a
brother of the very celebrated Bohemian harp player who drowned
himself in the Seine in 1790. In his youth Krumpholz had been
for a period of three years a pupil of Haydn at Esterhaz and had
played first violin in the orchestra there. He left Esterhaz to enter
the service of Prince Kinsky, but came to Vienna in 1795 to join
the operatic orchestra, and at once became noted as a performer
in Haydn’s quartets. He was (says Eugene Eiserle in Glöggl’s
“<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Neue Wiener Musik-Zeitung</span>” of August 13, 1857),</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>a highly sensitive art-enthusiast, and one of the first of those who foresaw
and recognized Beethoven’s greatness. He attached himself to Beethoven
with such pertinacity and self-sacrifice that the latter, though he always
called him “his fool,” accepted him as “a most intimate friend,” made
him acquainted with all his plans for compositions and generally reposed
the utmost confidence in him. Krumpholz formed also an exceedingly
close friendship with his countryman Wenzel Czerny, a music-teacher
living in the Leopoldstadt, and from 1797 onward spent most of his
leisure evenings with the Czerny family, and thus the little son Karl,
in his eighth and ninth years, learned almost daily what works Beethoven
had in hand, and, like Krumpholz, became filled with enthusiasm for
the tone-hero.</p></div>

<p>Krumpholz was a virtuoso on the mandolin, and hence, probably,
that page of sketches by Beethoven in the Artaria Collection
headed “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Sonatine für Mandolin u. P. F.</span>” Among the Zmeskall
papers in the Royal Imperial Library in Vienna there is a half-sheet
of coarse foolscap paper upon which is written with lead-pencil
in huge letters by the hand of Beethoven,</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The Music Count is dismissed with infamy to-day.&mdash;</p>

<p>The First Violin will be exiled to the misery of Siberia.</p>

<p>The <i>Baron</i> is forbidden for a whole month to ask questions and
never again to be overhasty, and he must concern himself with nothing
but his <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ipse miserum</i>.</p>

<p class="sig">
B.</p></div>

<p>“Music Count” and “Baron” are, of course, Zmeskall; but
these notices of Beethoven’s various first violins show the folly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
of attempting to decide whether one of them or Schuppanzigh was
to be sent to Siberia, so long as there is no hint whatever as to
the time and occasion of the note.</p>

<p>The very common mistake of forgetting that there is a time
in the lives of distinguished men when they are but aspirants to
fame, when they have their reputations still to make, often, in fact,
attracting less notice and raising feebler hopes of future distinction
in those who know them, than many a more precocious contemporary&mdash;this
mistake has thrown the figures of Schuppanzigh
and his associates in the quartet concerts at Prince Carl Lichnowsky’s
into a very false prominence in the picture of these first
seven years of Beethoven’s Vienna life. The composer himself
was not the Beethoven whom we know. Had he died in 1800,
his place in musical history would have been that of a great pianoforte
player and of a very promising young composer, whose
decease thus in his prime had disappointed well-founded hopes
of great future eminence.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Schuppanzigh and His Quartet</span></div>

<p>This is doubly true of the members of the quartet. Had they
passed away in early manhood, not one of them, except perhaps
young Kraft, the only one who ever distinguished himself as a
virtuoso upon his instrument, would have been remembered in
the annals of music. They were during these years but laying
the foundation for future excellence and celebrity as performers
of Mozart’s, Haydn’s, Förster’s and Beethoven’s quartets. Schuppanzigh,
first violin, and Weiss, viola, alone appear to have been
constantly associated in their quartet-playing. Kraft, violoncellist,
was often absent, when his father, or Zmeskall, or some
other, supplied his place; and as the second violin was often taken
by the master of the house, when they were engaged for private
concerts, Sina was, naturally, absent. Still, from 1794 to 1799,
the four appear to have practised much and very regularly together.
They enjoyed an advantage known to no other quartet&mdash;that
of playing the compositions of Haydn and Förster under the
eyes of the composers, and being taught by them every effect
that the music was intended to produce. Each of the performers,
therefore, knowing precisely the intentions of the composer, acquired
the difficult art of being independent and at the same time
of being subordinate to the general effect. When Beethoven began
to compose quartets he had, therefore, a set of performers schooled
to perfection by his great predecessors, and who already had
experience in his own music through his trios and quartets.</p>

<p>Ignatz Schuppanzigh, the leader, born 1776, died March 2,
1830 in Vienna, originally studied music as a dilettante and became<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
a capital player of the viola; but, about the time when Beethoven
came to Vienna, he exchanged that instrument for the violin and
made music his profession. He was fond of directing orchestral
performances and seems to have gained a considerable degree of
local reputation and to have been somewhat of a favorite in that
capacity before reaching his 21st year. In 1798-99, he took charge
of those concerts in the Augarten established by Mozart and
Martin, and afterwards led by Rudolph. Seyfried, writing after
his death, calls Schuppanzigh a “natural born and really energetic
leader of the orchestra.” The difference in age, character and
social position between him and Beethoven was such as not to
admit between them that higher and nobler friendship which
united the latter and Zmeskall; but they could be, and were, of
great use to each other, and there was a strong personal liking,
if not affection, which was mutual. Schuppanzigh’s person early
assumed very much of the form and proportions of Sterne’s Dr.
Slop, and after his return from Russia he is one of the “Milord
Falstaffs” of Beethoven’s correspondence and Conversation Books.
His obesity was, however, already the subject of the composer’s
jests, and he must have been an exceedingly good-tempered young
man, to bear with and forgive the coarse and even abusive
text of the short vocal piece (1801) headed “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Lob auf den Dicken</span>”
(“Praise of the Fat One”). But it is evidently a mere jest, and
was taken as such. It is worthy of note that Beethoven and
Schuppanzigh in addressing each other used neither the familiar
“<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">du</span>” nor the respectful “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Sie</span>,” but “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">er</span>”&mdash;a fact which has been
supposed to prove Beethoven’s great contempt for the violinist;
but as it would prove equal contempt on the other side, it proves
too much. Of Sina and Weiss, both Silesians by birth, there is
little that need be added here. Weiss became the first viola
player of Vienna, and a not unsuccessful composer of ballet and
other music.</p>

<p>Anton Kraft (the father) came from Bohemia to pursue his
legal studies in Vienna, but abandoned them to enter the Imperial
Court Orchestra as violoncellist. In 1778, he accepted an invitation
from Haydn to join the orchestra in Esterhaz; where, on
the 18th of December of the same year, his son Nicholas Anton
was born. The child, endowed by nature with great musical
talents, enjoyed the advantages of his father’s instructions and
example and of growing up under the eye of Haydn and in the
constant study of that great musician’s works. Upon the death
of Esterhazy and the dispersion of his orchestra, Kraft came with
his son, now in his fourteenth year, to Vienna. On April 15th,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
1792, Nicholas played a concerto composed by his father at the
“Widows and Orphans” concert, and on the 21st again appeared
in a concert given by the father. Notwithstanding a very remarkable
success, the son was destined for another profession than
music; and from this time until his eighteenth year, he played
his instrument only as an amateur, and as such Beethoven first
knew the youth. But when the young Prince Lobkowitz formed
his orchestra in 1796, both the Krafts were engaged, and Nicholas
Anton thenceforth made music his profession. In the maturity
of his years and powers, his only rival among all the German
violoncellists was Bernhard Romberg.</p>

<p>Schindler, with his characteristic inattention to dates,
observes, speaking of Schuppanzigh, Weiss and the elder Kraft:</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Knowledge of Orchestral Instruments</span></div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>These three artists are intimately connected with the development
of Beethoven and, indeed, with a large portion of his creations; wherefore
they will frequently be remembered here. Meanwhile it may suffice
to say that it was to this company of practically-trained musicians that
the rising young composer owed his knowledge of the efficient use of
stringed instruments. In addition are to be mentioned Joseph Friedlowsky,
who taught our master the mechanism of the clarinet, and the
famous hornist, Johann Wenzel Stich, who called himself Giovanni
Punto in Italian, to whom Beethoven owed what he knew of the proper
writing for horn, of which he already gave striking illustration in his
Sonata for Horn, Op.&nbsp;17. In the mechanism of the flute and its construction,
which underwent so many changes in the first decades of the
century, Carl Scholl steadily remained Beethoven’s instructor.</p></div>

<p>There is doubtless some degree of truth in this in so far as
it relates to a later period. Punto, of course, gave Beethoven a
new revelation of the powers and possibilities of the horn, as
Dragonetti did of the contrabass; but he first came to Vienna
near the end of 1799, and died at Prague only three years after
(February 16, 1803). All the others here named by Schindler&mdash;with
one exception, the elder Kraft&mdash;were youths of 16-18
years, when Beethoven composed his first and second concertos&mdash;works
which prove that he was not altogether ignorant of the
use of orchestral instruments! Had Schindler known something
of the history of Max Franz’s orchestra in Bonn, he would have
avoided many a mistake.<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span></p>
<p>Johann Nepomuk Hummel, the pupil of Mozart, was another
of the youths whom Beethoven drew into his circle. In 1795, the
elder Hummel brought back his son to Vienna (from that very
successful concert tour which had occupied the last six years and
had made the boy known even to the cities of distant Scotland)
and put him to the studies of counterpoint and composition with
Albrechtsberger and Salieri. He seems to have been quietly
at his studies, playing only in private, until April 28th, 1799,
when he again appeared in public both as pianist and composer,
in a concert in the Augartensaal, directed by Schuppanzigh. “He
performed a symphony besides a melodrama composed for the
occasion and between them played prettily <i>composed</i> improvisations
on the pianoforte.” That the talented and promising boy
of seventeen years should, upon arriving home again, seek the
acquaintance and favor of one who during his absence had made
so profound an impression upon the Vienna public as Beethoven,
and that the latter should have rejoiced to show kindness to
Mozart’s favorite pupil, hardly needs to be mentioned. A chapter
of description would not illustrate the nature of their intercourse
so vividly, as two short but exceedingly characteristic notes of
Beethoven’s which Hummel preserved and which found their
way into print after his death:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

</p></div>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Envious Viennese Musicians</span></div>

<p>In a letter to Eleonore von Breuning, Beethoven described
many of the Vienna pianists as his “deadly enemies.” Schindler’s
observations upon the composer’s relations with the Viennese<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
musicians, though written in his peculiar style, seem to be very
judicious and correct.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Nobody is likely to expect, he says (Vol. I, 23-24), that an artist
who made his way upwards as our Beethoven, although almost confining
his activities exclusively to aristocratic circles that upheld him in extraordinary
fashion, would remain free from the attacks of his colleagues;
on the contrary, the reader will be prepared to see a host of enemies
advance against him because of the shining qualities and evidences of
genius of our hero, in contrast with the heavy burden of social idiosyncrasies
and uncouthness. More than anything else, what seemed least
tolerable to his opponents was the notion that his appearance, the
excitability which he controlled too little in his intercourse with his
colleagues and his lack of consideration in passing judgment were natural
accompaniments of genius. His too small toleration of many bizarreries
and weaknesses of high society, and on the other hand his severe demand
on his colleagues for higher culture, even his Bonn dialect, afforded his
enemies more than enough material to revenge themselves on him by
evil gossip and slander.... The musicians in Vienna at that time,
with a very few exceptions, were lacking, not only in artistic, but also
in the most necessary degree of general, education and were as full of the
envy of handicraftsmen as the members of the guilds themselves. There
was a particular antipathy to all foreigners as soon as they manifested a
purpose to make their homes in the imperial city.</p></div>

<p>Schindler might have added that the change had been in no
small degree produced through the instructions and example of
Beethoven as they acted upon the Czernys, Moscheles and other
young admirers of his genius. In short, Beethoven’s instant
achievement of a position as artist only paralleled by Mozart and
of a social rank which Gluck, Salieri, Haydn had gained only after
making their names famous throughout Europe, together with
the general impression that the mantle of Mozart had fallen upon
him&mdash;all this begat bitter envy in those whom his talents and
genius overshadowed; they revenged themselves by deriding him
for his personal peculiarities and by condemning and ridiculing
the novelties in his compositions; while he met their envy with
disdain, their criticisms with contempt; and, when he did not
treat their compositions with indifference, but too often only
noticed them with sarcasm.</p>

<p>This picture, certainly, is not an agreeable one, but all the
evidence proves it, unfortunately, faithful. Such men as Salieri,
Gyrowetz, Weigl, are not to be understood as included in the
term “pianist” as used by Beethoven in his letter to Eleonore
von Breuning. For these men “stood high in Beethoven’s respect,”
says Schindler, and his words are confirmed to the fullest extent
by the Conversation Books and other authorities; which also<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
show that Eybler’s name might have been added to the list.
They were all more or less older than Beethoven, and for their
contrapuntal learning, particularly in the case of Weigl and Eybler,
he esteemed them very highly. No indications, however, have
been found, that he was upon terms of close private friendship
and intimacy with either.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Friendships with Women</span></div>

<p>Beethoven was no exception to the general rule, that men of
genius delight in warm and lasting friendships with women of
superior minds and culture&mdash;not meaning those “conquests” which,
according to Wegeler, even during his first three years in Vienna,
“he occasionally made, which if not impossible for many an Adonis
would still have been difficult.” Let such matters, even if details
concerning them were now attainable, be forgotten. His celibacy
was by no means owing to a deliberate choice of a single life.
What is necessary and proper of the little that is known on <i>this</i>
point will, in due time, be imparted simply and free from gloss
or superfluous comment. As to his friendships with the other
sex, it would be throwing the view of them into very false perspective
to employ those of later years in giving piquancy to a
chapter here. Let them also come in due order and thus, while
they lose nothing of interest, they may, perchance afford relief
and give brightness to canvas which otherwise might sometimes
become too sombre. Happily during these prosperous years now
before us, the picture has been for the most part bright and sunny
and the paucity of the information upon the topic in question is
of less consequence.</p>

<p>In the present connection one of our old Bonn friends again
comes upon the scene. The beautiful, talented and accomplished
Magdalene Willmann was invited to sing at Venice during the
carnival of 1794. She left Bonn the preceding summer with her
brother Max and his wife (Fräulein Tribolet) to fulfill the engagement.
After leaving Venice, they gave a concert in Gratz, and
journeyed on to Vienna. Here Max and his wife remained, having
accepted engagements from Schikaneder, while Magdalene went
on to Berlin. Not suiting the operatic public there she returned
to Vienna, and was soon engaged to sing both German and Italian
parts in the Court Opera. Beethoven renewed his intercourse
with them and soon became so captivated with the charms of
the beautiful Magdalene as to offer her his hand. This fact was
communicated to the author by a daughter of Max Willmann,
still living in 1860, who had often heard her father speak of it.
To the question, why her aunt did not accept the offer of Beethoven,
Madame S. hesitated a moment, and then, laughing,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
replied: “Because he was so ugly, and half crazy!” In 1799,
Magdalene married a certain Galvani, but her happiness was
short; she died toward the end of 1801.</p>

<p>Two letters of Beethoven to be found in the printed collection
have been preserved from the period before us, addressed to
Christine Gerhardi, a young woman of high distinction in society
at the time for the splendor of her talents and her high culture.
Dr. Sonnleithner wrote of her:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>She was the daughter of an official at the court of the Emperor
Leopold II ... an excellent singer, but remained a dilettante and sang
chiefly in concerts for charitable purposes (which she herself arranged),
or for the benefit of eminent artists. Old Professor Peter Frank was
director of the general hospital of Vienna in the neighborhood of which
(No. 20 Alserstrasse) she lived. He was a great lover of music, but
his son, Dr. Joseph Frank, was a greater; he made essays in composition
and arranged musical soirées at the home of his father at which Beethoven
and Fräulein Gerhardi took part, playing and singing. The son
frequently composed cantatas, which Beethoven corrected, for the name-days
and birthdays of his father, and in which Fräulein Gerhardi sang
the soprano solos.... She was at the time the most famous amateur
singer in Vienna, and inasmuch as Haydn knew her well there is no
doubt but that he had her in mind when he composed “The Creation”;
indeed, she sang the soprano part with great applause not only at Schwarzenberg
but also at the first performance in the Burgtheater. All reports
agree that she met Beethoven often at Frank’s and that he frequently
accompanied her singing on the pianoforte. He did not give her lessons.</p></div>

<p>Dr. Joseph von Frank and Christine Gerhardi were married
on August 20, 1798; they moved away from Vienna in 1804.</p>

<p>A few notes upon certain young women to whom Beethoven
dedicated compositions at this period of his life may form no
inappropriate close to this chapter. It was much the custom then
for teachers of music to dedicate their works to pupils, especially
to those who belonged to the higher social ranks&mdash;such dedications
being at the same time compliments to the pupils and advertisements
for the instructors, with the farther advantage often of
being sources of pecuniary profit. When, therefore, we read the
name of Baroness Albini on the title-page of certain sonatas by
Sterkel, of Julia Countess Guicciardi on one by Kleinheinz, of
Anna Countess Mailath on songs by Teyber, we assume at once
the probability in these and like instances that the relation of
master and pupil existed. Beethoven also followed the custom;
and the young ladies, subjects of the following notices, are all
known or supposed to have taken lessons of him.</p>

<p>Anna Louisa Barbara (“La Comtesse Babette”) was the
daughter of Karl Count Keglevics de Busin, of Hungarian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
Croatian lineage, and Barbara Countess Zichy. She married
Prince Innocenz d’Erba Odescalchi on the 10th of February, 1801
(another authority gives 1800). Beethoven’s dedications to her
are the Sonata, Op.&nbsp;7 (published in 1797), the Variations “La
stessa la stessissima” (1799), and the Pianoforte Concerto, Op.&nbsp;15,
1801&mdash;the last to her as Princess Odescalchi. A note by the
composer to Zmeskall&mdash;which, judging both from its contents
and the handwriting, could not have been written later than 1801-2&mdash;shows
that the Odescalchi palace was one of those at which he
took part in musical soirées.</p>

<p>“Countess Henriette Lichnowsky,” writes Count Amade, “was
the sister of the ruling Prince Carl, and was doubtless married
to the Marquis of Carneville after the dedication to her of the
Rondo (G major, Op.&nbsp;51, No. 2, published in September, 1802);
she lived in Paris after her marriage and died about 1830.” The
Rondo was first dedicated to Countess Giulietta Guicciardi, but
Beethoven asked it back in exchange for the C-sharp minor Sonata;
to which fact we shall recur presently. Countess Thun, to whom
Beethoven dedicated the Clarinet Trio, Op.&nbsp;11, in 1797, was the
mother of Prince Carl Lichnowsky and Countess Henriette Lichnowsky.
She died May 18, 1800. The Sonata in E-flat, Op.&nbsp;27,
No. 1, was dedicated to Josepha Sophia, wife of Prince Johann
Joseph von Liechtenstein, daughter of Joachim Egon, Landgrave
of Fürstenberg-Weitra. She was born on June 20, 1776, married
on April 22, 1792 and died February 23, 1848. Whether her
father was related at all, and if so, how, to the Fürstenberg in
whose house Beethoven gave lessons in Bonn, is not known. Her
husband, however, was first cousin to Count Ferdinand von Waldstein.
The Baroness Braun to whom Beethoven dedicated the
two Pianoforte Sonatas Op.&nbsp;14 and the Sonata for Horn in 1801,
was the wife of Baron Peter von Braun, lessee of the Nationaltheater
and afterwards of the Theater an der Wien. The dedications
disclose an early association which eventually led to Beethoven’s
being asked to compose an opera. It is not known that
Beethoven was a social visitor in the house of Baron Braun, but
he was a highly respected guest in the house of Count Browne, to
whose wife Beethoven dedicated the “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Waldmädchen</span>” Variations
and the three Pianoforte Sonatas, Op.&nbsp;10.</p>

Tastes&mdash;His Letters&mdash;Manner of Composing&mdash;The
Sketchbooks&mdash;Origin of His Deafness.</p></div>


<p>The year 1800 is an important era in Beethoven’s history. It
is the year in which, cutting loose from the pianoforte, he
asserted his claims to a position with Mozart and the still
living and productive Haydn in the higher forms of chamber and
orchestral composition&mdash;the quartet and the symphony. It is
the year, too, in which the bitter consciousness of an increasing
derangement of his organs of hearing was forced upon him and the
terrible anticipation of its incurable nature and of its final result
in almost total deafness began to harass and distress him. The
course of his life was afterwards so modified, on the one hand,
by the prosperous issue of these new appeals to the taste and
judgment of the public, and, on the other, by the unhappy progress
of his malady, each acting and reacting upon a nature singularly
exceptional, that for this and other reasons some points in his
personal character and habits, and a few general remarks upon
and illustrations of another topic or two must be made before
resuming the narrative of events.</p>

<p>A true and exhaustive picture of Beethoven as a man would
present an almost ludicrous contrast to that which is generally
entertained as correct. As sculptors and painters have each in
turn idealized the work of his predecessor, until the composer
stands before us like a Homeric god until those who knew him
personally, could they return to earth, would never suspect that
the grand form and noble features of the more pretentious portraits
are intended to represent the short muscular figure and pock-pitted
face of their old friend&mdash;so in literature evoked by the composer
a similar process has gone on, with a corresponding suppression
of whatever is deemed common and trivial, until he is made
a being living in his own peculiar realm of gigantic ideas, above<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
and apart from the rest of mankind&mdash;a sort of intellectual Thor,
dwelling in “darkness and clouds of awful state,” and making
in his music mysterious revelations of things unutterable! But
it is really some generations too soon for a conscientious investigator
of his history to view him as a semi-mythological personage,
or to discover that his notes to friends asking for pens, making
appointments to dinner at taverns, or complaining of servants,
are “cyclopean blocks of granite,” which, like the “chops and
tomato sauce” of Mr. Pickwick, contain depths unfathomable
of profound meaning. The present age must be content to find
in Beethoven, with all his greatness, a very human nature, one
which, if it showed extraordinary strength, exhibited also extraordinary
weaknesses.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Inconsistent Traits of Character</span></div>

<p>It was the great misfortune of Beethoven’s youth&mdash;his impulses
good and bad being by nature exceedingly quick and violent&mdash;that
he did not grow up under the influence of a wise and strict
parental control, which would have given him those habits of
self-restraint that, once fixed, are a second and better nature,
and through which the passions, curbed and moderated, remain
only as sources of noble energy and power. His very early admission
into the orchestra of the theatre as cembalist, was more to
the advantage of his musical than of his moral development.
It was another misfortune that, in those years, when the strict
regulations of a school would have compensated in some measure
for the unwise, unsteady, often harsh discipline of his father, he
was thus thrown into close connection with actors and actresses,
who, in those days, were not very distinguished for the propriety
of their manners and morals. Before his seventeenth or eighteenth
year, when he became known to the Breuning family and Count
Waldstein, he could hardly have learned the importance of cultivating
those high principles of life and conduct on which in later
years he laid so much stress. And, at that period of life, the
character even under ordinary circumstances is so far developed,
the habits have become so far formed and fixed, and the natural
tendencies have acquired so much strength, that it is, as a rule,
too late to conquer the power of a perfect self-command. At all
events, the consequences of a deficient early moral education followed
Beethoven through life and are visible in the frequent
contests between his worse and his better nature and in his constant
tendency to extremes. To-day, upon some perhaps trivial
matter, he bursts into ungovernable wrath; to-morrow, his penitence
exceeds the measure of his fault. To-day he is proud, unbending,
offensively careless of those claims which society grants to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
people of high rank; to-morrow his humility is more than adequate
to the occasion. The poverty in which he grew up was not without
its effect upon his character. He never learned to estimate money
at its real value; though often profuse and generous to a fault,
even wasteful, yet at times he would fall into the other extreme.
With all his sense of nobility of independence, he early formed
the habit of leaning upon others; and this the more, as his malady
increased, which certainly was a partial justification; but he thus
became prone to follow unwise counsels, or, when his pride was
touched, to assert an equally unwise independence. At other
times, in the multitude of counsellors he became the victim of
utter irresolution, when decision and firmness were indispensable
and essential to his welfare. Thus, both by following
the impulse of the moment, and by hesitation when a prompt
determination was demanded, he took many a false step, which
could no longer be retrieved when reflection brought with it
bitter regret.</p>

<p>It would be doing great injustice both to Beethoven and to
the present writer to understand the preceding remarks as being
intended to represent the composer’s lapses in these regards, as
being more than unpleasant and unfortunate episodes in the
general tenor of his life; but as they did occur to his great
disadvantage, the fact cannot be silently passed over.</p>

<p>A romantically sentimental admiration of the heroes of
ancient classic literature, having its origin in Paris, had become
widely the fashion in Beethoven’s youth. The democratic theories
of the French sentimentalists had received a new impulse from
the dignified simplicity of the foreign representatives of the young
American Republic, Franklin, Adams, Jay&mdash;from the retirement
to private life on their plantations and farms of the great military
leaders in the contest, Washington, Greene, Schuyler, Knox and
others, after the war with England was over; from the pride
taken by the French officers, who had served in America, in their
insignia of the order of the Cincinnati; and even from the letters
and journals of German officers, who, in captivity, had formed
friendships with many of the better class of the republican leaders,
and seen with their own eyes in what simplicity they lived while
guiding the destinies of the new-born nation. Thus through
the greater part of Central Europe the idea became current of
a pure and sublime humanity, above and beyond the influence
of the passions, of which Cincinnatus, Scipio, Cato, Washington,
Franklin, were the supposed representatives. Zschokke makes
his Heuwen say: “Virtue and the heroes of antiquity had inspired<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
me with enthusiasm for virtue and heroism”; and so, also, Beethoven.
He exalted his imagination and fancy by the perusal
of the German poets and translations of the ancient and English
classics, especially Homer, Plutarch and Shakespeare; dwelt
fondly upon the great characters as models for the conduct of
life; but between the sentiment which one feels and the active
principle on which he acts, there is often a wide cleft. That
Beethoven proved to be no Stoic, that he never succeeded in
governing his passions with absolute sway, was not because
the spirit was unwilling; the flesh was weak. Adequate firmness
of character had not been acquired in early years. But those
who have most thoroughly studied his life, know best how pure
and lofty were his aspirations, how wide and deep his sympathies
with all that is good, how great his heart, how, on the whole,
heroic his endurance of his great calamity. They can best feel the
man’s true greatness, admire the nobility of his nature, and drop
the tear of sorrow and regret upon his vagaries and faults. He
who is morbidly sensitive, and compelled to keep constant ward
and watch over his passions, can best appreciate and sympathize
with the man, Beethoven.</p>

<p>Truth and candor compel the confession, that in those days
of prosperity he bore his honors with less of meekness than we
could wish; that he had lost something of that modesty and
ingenuousness eulogized by Junker ten years before, in his Mergentheim
letter. His “somewhat lofty bearing” had even been
reported by the correspondent of the “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Allgemeine Musikalische
Zeitung</span>.” Traces of self-sufficiency and even arrogance&mdash;faults
almost universal among young and successful geniuses, often in
a far higher degree than was true of Beethoven, and with not a
tithe of his reason&mdash;are unquestionably visible. No one can read
without regret his remarks upon certain persons not named,
with whom at this very time he was upon terms of apparently
intimate friendship. “I value them,” he writes, “only by what
they do for me.... I look upon them only as instruments
upon which I play when I feel so disposed.” His “somewhat
lofty bearing” was matter for jest to the venerable Haydn, who,
according to a trustworthy tradition, when Beethoven’s visits
to him had become few and far between would inquire of other
visitors: “How goes it with our Great Mogul?” Nor would
the young nobles, whose society he frequented, take offence; but
it certainly made him enemies among those whom he “valued
according to their service and looked upon as mere instruments”&mdash;and
no wonder!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span></p>

<p>Pierson, in his edition of the so-called “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Beethoven’s Studien</span>,”
has added to Seyfried’s personal sketches a few reminiscences
of that Griesinger, who was so long Saxon Minister in Vienna,
and to whom we owe the valuable “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Biographische Notizen über
Joseph Haydn</span>.” One of his anecdotes is to the purpose here
and may be taken as substantially historical.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Beethoven’s Self-Esteem Injured</span></div>

<p>When he was still only an attaché, and Beethoven was little
known except as a celebrated pianoforte player, both being still
young, they happened to meet at the house of Prince Lobkowitz.
In conversation with a gentleman present, Beethoven said in
substance, that he wished to be relieved from all bargain and
sale of his works, and would gladly find some one willing to pay
him a certain income for life, for which he should possess the
exclusive right of publishing all he wrote; adding, “and I would
not be idle in composition. I believe Goethe does this with Cotta,
and, if I mistake not, Handel’s London publisher held similar
terms with him.”</p>

<p>“My dear young man,” returned the other, “You must not
complain; for you are neither a Goethe nor a Handel, and it is
not to be expected that you ever will be; for such masters will
not be born again.” Beethoven bit his lips, gave a most contemptuous
glance at the speaker, and said no more. Lobkowitz
endeavored to appease him, and in a subsequent conversation
said:</p>

<p>“My dear Beethoven, the gentleman did not intend to wound
you. It is an established maxim, to which most men adhere,
that the present generation cannot possibly produce such mighty
spirits as the dead, who have already earned their fame.”</p>

<p>“So much the worse, Your Highness,” retorted Beethoven:
“but with men who will not believe and trust in me because
I am as yet unknown to universal fame, I cannot hold intercourse!”</p>

<p>It is easy for this generation, which has the productions of
the composer’s whole life as the basis of its judgment of his
powers, to speak disparagingly of his contemporaries for not being
able to discover in his first twelve or fifteen works good reason
for classing him with Goethe and Handel; but he who stand
upon a mountain cannot justly ridicule him on the plain for the
narrow extent of his view. It was as difficult then to conceive
the possibility of instrumental music being elevated to heights
greater than those reached by Haydn and Mozart, as it is for us
to conceive of Beethoven being hereafter surpassed.</p>

<p>In the short personal sketches of Beethoven’s friends which
have been introduced, the dates of their births have been noted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
so far as known, that the reader may observe how very large a
proportion of them were of the same age as the composer, or still
younger&mdash;some indeed but boys&mdash;when he came to Vienna. And
so it continued. As the years pass by in our narrative and names
familiar to us disappear, the new ones which take their places,
with rare exceptions, are still of men much younger than himself.
The older generation of musical amateurs at Vienna, van
Swieten and his class, had accepted the young Bonn organist
and patronized him, as a pianist. But when Beethoven began
to press his claims as a composer, and, somewhat later, as his
deafness increased, to neglect his playing, some of the elder friends
had passed away, others had withdrawn from society, and the
number was few of those who, like Lichnowsky, could comprehend
that departures from the forms and styles of Mozart and
Haydn were not necessarily faults. With the greater number, as
perfection necessarily admits of no improvement and both quartet
and symphony in <i>form</i> had been carried to that point by Haydn
and Mozart, it was a perfectly logical conclusion that farther
progress was impossible. They could not perceive that there
was still room for the invention or discovery of new elements of
interest, beauty, power; for such perceptions are the offspring
of genius. With Beethoven they were instinctive.</p>

<p>One more remark: Towards the decline of life, the masterpieces
of literature and art, on which the taste was formed, are
apt to become invested in the mind with a sort of nimbus of
sanctity; hence, the productions of a young and daring innovator,
even when the genius and talent displayed in them are felt and
receive just acknowledgement, have the aspect, not only of an
extravagant and erring waste of misapplied powers, but of a
kind of profane audacity. For these and similar reasons Beethoven’s
novelties found little favor with the veterans of the
concert-room.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">The Homage of Young Disciples</span></div>

<p>The criticism of the day was naturally ruled and stimulated
by the same spirit. Beethoven’s own confession how it at
first wounded him, will come in its order; but after he felt that
his victory over it was sure&mdash;was in fact gained with a younger
generation&mdash;he only laughed at the critics; to answer them,
except by new works, was beneath him. Seyfried says of him
(during the years of the “Eroica,” “Fidelio,” etc.): “When he
came across criticisms in which he was accused of grammatical
errors he rubbed his hands in glee and cried out with a loud laugh:
‘Yes, yes! they marvel and put their heads together because
they do not find it in any school of thoroughbass!’” But for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
young of both sexes, Beethoven’s music had an extraordinary
charm. And this not upon technical grounds, nor solely for its
novelties, always an attractive feature to the young, but because
it appealed to the sensibilities, excited emotions and touched the
heart as no other purely instrumental compositions had ever done.
And so it was that Beethoven also in his quality of composer
soon gathered about him a circle of young disciples, enthusiastic
admirers. Their homage may well have been grateful to him&mdash;as
such is to every artist and scholar of genius, who, striking
out and steadfastly pursuing a new path, subjects himself to
the sharp animadversions of critics who, in all honesty, really
can see little or nothing of good in that which is not to be measured
and judged by old standards. The voice of praise under such
circumstances is doubly pleasing. It is known that, when Beethoven’s
works began to find a just appreciation from a new generation
of critics, who had indeed been schooled by them, he collected
and preserved a considerable number of laudatory articles,
whose fate cannot now be traced. When, however, the natural
and just satisfaction which is afforded by the homage of honest
admirers and deservedly eulogistic criticism, degenerates into
a love of indiscriminate praise and flattery, it becomes a weakness,
a fault. Of this error in Beethoven there are traces easily
discernible, and especially in his later years; there are pages of
fulsome eulogy addressed to him in the Conversation Books,
which would make the reader blush for him, did not the mere
fact that such books existed remind him of the bitterness of the
composer’s lot. The failing was also sometimes his misfortune;
for those who were most profuse in their flatteries, and thus
gained his ear, were by no means the best of his counsellors. But
aside from the attractive force of his genius, Beethoven possessed
a personal magnetism, which attached his young worshippers
to him and, all things considered, to his solid and lasting benefit
in his private affairs. Just at this time, and for some years to
come, his brothers usually rendered him the aid he needed; but
thenceforth to the close of his life, the names of a constant succession
of young men will appear in and vanish from our narrative,
who were ever necessary to him and ever ready at his call with
their voluntary services.</p>

<p>Beethoven’s love of nature was already a marked trait of
his character. This was indulged and strengthened by long
rambles upon the lofty hills and in the exquisitely beautiful valleys
which render the environs of Vienna to the north and west so
charming. Hence, when he left the city to spend the hot summer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
months in the country, with but an exception or two in a long
series of years, his residence was selected with a view to the indulgence
of this noble passion. Hence, too, his great delight
in the once celebrated work of Christian Sturm: “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Beobachtungen
über die Werke Gottes</span>,” which, however absurd much of its natural
philosophy (in the old editions) appears now in the light
of advanced knowledge, was then by far the best manual of
popular scientific truth, and was unsurpassed in fitness to awaken
and foster a taste for, and the understanding of, the beauties of
nature. Schindler has recorded the master’s life-long study and
admiration of this book. It was one which cherished his veneration
for the Creator and Preserver of the universe, and yet left
his contempt for procrustean religious systems and ecclesiastical
dogmas its free course. “To him, who, in the love of Nature,
holds communion with her visible forms, she speaks a various
language,” says Bryant. Her language was thoroughly well understood
by Beethoven; and when, in sorrow and affliction, his
art, his Plutarch, his “Odyssey,” proved to be resources too feeble
for his comfort, he went to Nature for solace, and rarely failed
to find it.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Beethoven’s Moral Principles</span></div>

<p>Art has been so often disgraced by the bad morals and shameless
lives of its votaries, that it is doubly gratifying to be able to
affirm of Beethoven that, like Handel, Bach and Mozart, he
did honor to his profession by his personal character and habits.
Although irregular, still he was as simple and temperate in eating
and drinking as was possible in the state of society in which he
lived. That he was no inordinate lover of wine or strong drinks
is certain. No allusion is remembered in any of his letters, notes,
memoranda, nor in the Conversation Books, which indicates a
liking for any game of chance or skill. He does not appear to
have known one playing-card from another. Music, books, conversation
with men and women of taste and intelligence, dancing,
according to Ries (who adds that he could never learn to dance
in time&mdash;but Beethoven’s dancing days were soon over&mdash;), and,
above all, his long walks, were his amusements and recreations.
His whim for riding was of short duration&mdash;at all events, the
last allusion to any horse owned by him is in the anecdote on a
previous page.</p>

<p>One rather delicate point demands a word: and surely, what
Franklin in his autobiography could confess of himself, and Lockhart
mention without scruple of Walter Scott, his father-in-law,
need not be here suppressed. Nor can it well be, since a false
assumption on the point has been made the basis already of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
considerable quantity of fine writing, and employed to explain
certain facts relative to Beethoven’s compositions. Spending
his whole life in a state of society in which the vow of celibacy
was by no means a vow of chastity; in which the parentage of a
cardinal’s or archbishop’s children was neither a secret nor a
disgrace; in which the illegitimate offspring of princes and magnates
were proud of their descent and formed upon it well-grounded
hopes of advancement and success in life; in which the moderate
gratification of the sexual was no more discountenanced than
the satisfying of any other natural appetite&mdash;it is nonsense to
suppose, that, under such circumstances, Beethoven could have
puritanic scruples on that point. Those who have had occasion
and opportunity to ascertain the facts, know that he had not,
and are also aware that he did not always escape the common
penalties of transgressing the laws of strict purity. But he had
too much dignity of character ever to take part in scenes of low
debauchery, or even when still young to descend to the familiar
jesting once so common between tavern girls and the guests.
Thus, as the elder Simrock related, upon the journey to Mergentheim
recorded in the earlier pages of this work, it happened at
some place where the company dined, that some of the young
men prompted the waiting-girl to play off her charms upon Beethoven.
He received her advances and familiarities with repellent
coldness; and as she, encouraged by the others, still persevered,
he lost his patience, and put an end to her importunities by a
smart box on the ear.</p>

<p>The practice, not uncommon in his time, of living with an
unmarried woman as a wife, was always abhorrent to him&mdash;how
much so, a sad story will hereafter illustrate; to a still greater
degree an intrigue with the wife of another man. In his later
years he so broke off his once familiar intercourse with a distinguished
composer and conductor of Vienna, as hardly to return
his greetings with common politeness. Schindler affirmed that
the only reason for this was that the man in question had taken
to his bed and board the wife of another.</p>

<p>The names of two married women might be here given, to
whom at a later period Beethoven was warmly attached; names
which happily have hitherto escaped the eyes of literary scavengers,
and are therefore here suppressed. Certain of his friends used
to joke him about these ladies, and it is certain that he rather
enjoyed their jests even when the insinuations, that his affection
was beyond the limit of the Platonic, were somewhat broad; but
careful enquiry has failed to elicit any evidence that even in these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
cases he proved unfaithful to his principles. A story related by
Jahn is also to the point, viz.: that Beethoven only by the urgent
solicitations of the Czerny family was after much refusal persuaded
to extemporize in the presence of a certain Madame Hofdemel.
She was the widow of a man who had attempted her life and then
committed suicide; and the refusal of Beethoven to play before
her arose from his having the general belief at the time, that a
too great intimacy had existed between her and Mozart. Jahn,
it may be observed, has recently had the great satisfaction of
being able to prove the innocence of Mozart in this matter and
of rescuing his memory from the only dark shadow which rested
upon it. This much on this topic it has been deemed necessary
to say here, not only for the reason above given, but to put an
end to long-prevailing misconceptions and misconstructions of
passages in Beethoven’s letters and private memoranda and to
save farther comment when they shall be introduced hereafter.</p>

<p>Beethoven’s fine sense for the lyric element in poetry was
already conspicuous in the fine tact with which the texts of his
songs, belonging in date to his last years in Bonn, were selected
from the annual publications in which most of them appeared.
Another fine proof of this is afforded by a glance through the older
editions of Matthisson’s poems. In the fourth (1797), there are
but two which are really well adapted to composition in the song-form&mdash;the
“Adelaide” and “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Das Opferlied</span>.” A third Beethoven
left unfinished. He had doubtless been led to attempt its composition
through the force of its appeal to his personal feelings
and sympathies, but soon discovering its non-lyrical character
abandoned it. It is the “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Wunsch</span>.”</p>

<p>Rochlitz in his letters from Vienna (1822) reports Beethoven’s
humorous account of his enthusiasm for Klopstock in his early
life:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Since that summer in Carlsbad I read Goethe every day, that
is, when I read at all. He (Goethe) has killed Klopstock for me. You
are surprised? And now you laugh? Ah ha! It is because I have
read Klopstock. I carried him about with me for years while walking
and also at other times. Well, I did not always understand him, of
course. He leaps about so much and he begins at too lofty an elevation.
Always <i>Maestoso</i>, D-flat major! Isn’t it so? But he is great and uplifts
the soul nevertheless. When I could not understand him I could sort
of guess. If only he did not always want to die! That will come quickly
enough. Well, it always sounds well, at any rate, etc.</p></div>

<p>Thus, whatever scattered hints bearing upon the point come
under our notice combine to impart a noble idea of Beethoven’s
poetic taste and culture, and to show that the allusions to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
ancient classic authors in his letters and conversation were not
made for display, but were the natural consequence of a love
for and a hearty appreciation of them derived from their frequent
perusal in translations.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Beethoven as a Letter-Writer</span></div>

<p>Beethoven’s correspondence forms so important a portion
of his biography that something must be said here upon his
character as a letter-writer. A few of his autograph letters bear
marks of previous study and careful elaboration; but, in general,
whatever he wrote in the way of private correspondence was
dashed off on the spur of the moment, and with no thought that
it would ever come under any eye but that for which it was intended.
It is therefore easy to imagine how energetically he
would have protested could he have known that his most insignificant
notes were preserved in such numbers, and that the time
would come when they would all be made public; or, still worse,
that some which were but the offspring of momentary pique
against those with whom he lived in closest relations would be
used after his death to their injury; and that outbursts of
sudden passion&mdash;when the wrong was perhaps as often on his
side as on the other&mdash;after all the parties concerned had passed
away, would have an almost judicial authority accorded to
them.</p>

<p>In studying a collection of some eight hundred of his letters
and notes,<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> originals and copies in print or manuscript, the most
striking fact is the insignificance of by far the greater number&mdash;that
so few bear marks of any care in their preparation, or
contain matter of any intrinsic value. In fact, perhaps the greater
part of the short notes to Zmeskall and others owe their origin
to Beethoven’s dislike of entrusting oral messages to his servants.
For the most part it is in vain to seek in his correspondence
anything bearing upon the theory or art of music; very seldom
is any opinion expressed upon the productions of any contemporary
composer; no vivid sketches of men and manners flow
from his pen, like those which render the letters of Mozart and
Mendelssohn so charming. The proportion of their correspondence
which possesses more than a merely biographical value was
large; of Beethoven’s very small.</p>

<p>His letters, of course, exhibit the usual imperfections of a
hasty and confidential correspondence; sometimes, indeed, of an
aggravated character. Some of them contain loose statements<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
of fact, such as all men are liable to make through haste or
imperfect knowledge; others contain passages of which the only
conceivable explanation is Schindler’s statement that Beethoven
sometimes amused himself with the harmless mystification of
others; but, taken together, the more important letters&mdash;while
they usually evince his difficulty in finding the best expressions
of his thoughts and his constant struggle with the rules of his
mother tongue&mdash;place his truth and candor in a very favorable
light and sometimes rise into a rude eloquence. The reader feels
that when the writer is unjust he is under the influence of a mistake
or passion&mdash;and, as a rule, it is not too late to detect such
injustice; that his errors of fact are simply mistakes, honestly
made and easily corrected; that if, in the mass, a few paragraphs
occur which can be neither fully justified nor excused, it is not
to be forgotten that they were not intended for our eyes and that
they were written under the constant pressure of a great calamity,
which made him doubly sensitive and irritable; and so it will
be easy, like Sterne’s Recording Angel, to blot such passages with
a tear.</p>

<p>Another striking fact of Beethoven’s correspondence, when
viewed as a whole, is the proof it affords that, except in his hours
of profound depression, he was far from being the melancholy
and gloomy character of popular belief. He shows himself here&mdash;as
he was by nature&mdash;of a gay and lively temperament, fond of
a jest, an inveterate though not always a very happy punster,
a great lover of wit and humor. It is a cause for profound
gratitude that it was so; since he thus preserved an elasticity
of spirits that enabled him to escape the consequences of brooding
in solitude over his great misfortune; to rise superior to his fate
and concentrate his great powers upon his self-imposed tasks; and
to meet with hope and courage the cruel fortune which put an
end to so many well-founded expectations and ambitious projects,
and confined him to a single road to fame and honor&mdash;that of
composition. It happens that several of the more valuable and
interesting of his letters belong to the period immediately following
that now before us, and in them we are able to trace, with
reasonable accuracy, the effect which his incipient and increasing
deafness produced upon him&mdash;first, the anxiety caused by earliest
symptoms; then the profound grief bordering upon despair when
the final result had become certain; and at last his submission
to and acceptance of his fate. There is in truth something nobly
heroic in the manner in which Beethoven at length rose superior
to his great affliction. The magnificent series of works produced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
in the ten years from 1798 to 1808 are no greater monuments
to his genius than to the godlike resolution with which he wrought
out the inspirations of that genius under circumstances most
fitted to weaken its efforts and restrain its energies.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Beethoven and His Sketchbooks</span></div>

<p>Beethoven was seldom without a folded sheet or two of
music paper in his pocket upon which he wrote with pencil in
two or three measures of music hints of any musical thought
which might occur to him wherever he chanced to be. Towards
the end of his life his Conversation Books often answered the
same purpose; and there are traditions of bills-of-fare at dining-rooms
having been honored with ideas afterwards made immortal.
This habit gave Abbé Gelinek a foundation for the following
amusing nonsense as related by Tomaschek: “He (Gelinek) declared,”
says Tomaschek,</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>as if it were an aphorism, that all of Beethoven’s compositions were
lacking in internal coherency and that not infrequently they were overloaded.
These things he looked upon as grave faults of composition
and sought to explain them from the manner in which Beethoven went
about his work, saying that he had always been in the habit of noting
every musical idea that occurred to him upon a bit of paper which he
threw into a corner of his room, and that after a while there was a considerable
pile of the memoranda which the maid was not permitted to touch
when cleaning the room. Now when Beethoven got into a mood for
work he would hunt a few musical <i>motivi</i> out of his treasure-heap which
he thought might serve as principal and secondary themes for the composition
in contemplation, and often his selection was not a lucky one.
I (Tomaschek) did not interrupt the flow of his passionate, yet awkward
speech, but briefly answered that I was unfamiliar with Beethoven’s
method of composing but was inclined to think that the aberrations
occasionally to be found in his compositions were to be ascribed to his
individuality, and that only an unprejudiced and keen psychologist,
who had had an opportunity to observe Beethoven from the beginning
of his artistic development to its maturity in order gradually to familiarize
himself with his views on art, could fit himself to give the musical
world an explanation of the intellectual cross-relationships in Beethoven’s
glorious works, a thing just as impossible to his blind enthusiasts as
to his virulent opponents. Gelinek may have applied these last words
to himself, and not incorrectly.</p></div>

<p>This conversation took place in 1814, the day after a rehearsal
of Beethoven’s Symphony in A&mdash;the Seventh! Gelinek’s
pile of little bits of paper in the corner of the room, when touched
by the wand of truth, resolves itself into blank music books, to
which his new ideas were transferred from the original slight
pencil sketches, and frequently with two or three words to indicate
the kind of composition to which they were suited. Divers
anecdotes are current which pretend to give the origin of some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
of the themes thus recorded and afterwards wrought out, but
few judicious readers will attach much weight to most of them.
For although conceptions can sometimes be traced directly to
their exciting causes, the musical composer can seldom say more
than that they occurred to him at such a time and place&mdash;and
often not even that. It is certainly not improbable that Beethoven’s
admirers may have questioned him upon this point, as
Schindler did upon the “Pastoral” Symphony, and that he was
able to satisfy them; but Handel’s “Harmonious Blacksmith”
may be taken as the type of most of the current stories, which
only need truth to make them interesting.</p>

<p>To return to the sketchbooks&mdash;which performed a twofold
office; being not alone the registers of new conceptions, but containing
the preliminary studies of the instrumental works into
which they were wrought out. The introduction to the excellent
pamphlet, “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Ein Skizzenbuch von Beethoven, beschrieben und
in Auszügen dargestellt von Gustav Nottebohm</span>,” though properly
confined by him to the single book which he was describing, is
equally true of so many that have been examined with care as
to warrant its general application. The following extracts may
be taken as true of the greater part of the sketchbooks:</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">How the Sketching Was Done</span></div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Before us (he says) lies a volume in oblong folio (<i>Teatro</i>) of 192
pages and bearing 16 staves on each page, and, save a few empty places,
containing throughout notes and sketches in Beethoven’s handwriting for
compositions of various sorts. The volume is bound in craftsman’s
style, trimmed, and has a stout pasteboard cover. It was bound thus
before it was used or received the notes. [Excepting the number of
pages this description applies to most of the true sketchbooks.] The
sketches are for the greater part one-part; that is, they occupy but a
single staff, only exceptionally are they on two or more staves. [In
some of the later books the proportion of sketches in two or more parts
is much greater than in this.] It is permissible to assume in advance that
they were written originally and in the order in which they follow each
other in the sketchbook. When a cursory glance over the whole does
not seem to contradict this assumption, a careful study nevertheless
compels a modification at times. It is to be observed that generally
Beethoven began a new page with a new composition; and, moreover,
that he worked alternately or simultaneously at different movements.
As a result, different groups of sketches are crowded so closely together
that in order to find room he was obliged to make use of spaces which
had been left open, and thus eventually sketches for the most different
compositions had to be mixed together and brought into companionship.
[In some of the books “vi-” not infrequently meets the eye. It
was the one of Beethoven’s modes of keeping the clue in the labyrinth
of sketches, being part of the word <i>vide</i>. The second syllable, “-de,”
can always be found on the same or a neighboring page.] “N.B.,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
“No. 100,” “No. 500,” “No. 1000,” etc., and in later sketches “meilleur,”
are common, all which signs are explained by Schindler as being a whimsical
mode of estimating the comparative value of different musical ideas,
or of forms of the same. Again Nottebohm continues: In spite of
this confused working it is plain that Beethoven, as a rule, was conscious
from the beginning of the goal for which he was striving, that he was
true to his first concept and carried out the projected form to the end.
The contrary is also true at times, and the sketchbook (like others)
disclosed a few instances in which Beethoven in the course was led from
the form originally conceived into another, so that eventually something
different appeared from what was planned in the first instance. (Once
more.) In general it may be observed that Beethoven in all his work
begun in the sketchbook proceeded in the most varied manner, and at
times reached his goal in a direction opposite to that upon which he
first set out. [At times] the thematic style dominates; the first
sketch breaks off abruptly with the principal subject and the work that
follows is confined to transforming and reshaping the thematic kernel
at first thrown on the paper until it appears to be fitted for development;
then the same process is undertaken with intermediary sections; everywhere
we find beginnings, never a whole; a whole comes before us only
outside of the sketchbook, in the printed composition where sections
which were scattered in the sketchbook are brought together. [In
other cases] the thematic manner is excluded; every sketch is aimed
at a unity and is complete in itself; the very first one gives the complete
outline for a section of a movement; those that follow are then complete
reshapings of the first, as other readings directed towards a change in
the summary character, or a reformation of the whole, an extension of
the middle sections, etc. Naturally, the majority of the sketches do not
belong exclusively to either of the two tendencies, but hover between
them, now leaning toward one, now toward the other.</p></div>

<p>One readily sees that, when the general plan of a work is
clear and distinct before the mind, it is quite indifferent in what
order the various parts are studied; and that Beethoven simply
adopted the method of many a dramatic and other author, who
sketches his scenes or chapters not in course but as mood, fancy
or opportunity dictates. It is equally evident that the composer
could have half a dozen works upon his hands at the same time,
not merely without disadvantage to any one of them, but to the
gain of all, since he could turn to one or another as the spirit of
composition impelled; like the author of a profound literary work,
who relieves and recreates his mind by varying his labors, and
executes his grand task all the more satisfactorily, because he,
from time to time, refreshes himself by turning his attention to
other and lighter topics. When Beethoven writes to Wegeler:
“As I am writing now I often compose three or four pieces at
once,” he could have referred only to the preliminary studies of
the sketchbooks. Sometimes, it is true, works were laid aside<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
incomplete after he had begun the task of writing them out in
full, and finished when occasion demanded; but as a rule his
practice was quite different, viz.: All the parts of a work having
been thus studied until he had determined upon the form, character
and style of every important division and subdivision, and recorded
the results in his sketchbook by a few of the first measures,
followed by “etc.” or “and so on,” the labor of composition may
be said to have been finished, and there remained only the task
of writing out the clean copy of what now existed full and complete
in his mind, and of making such minor corrections and
improvements as might occur to him on revision. The manuscripts
show that these were sometimes very numerous, though
they rarely extend to any change in the form or to any alteration
in the grand effect except to heighten it, or render it more unexpected
or exciting. When upon reflection he was dissatisfied
with a movement as a whole he seems rarely to have attempted
its improvement by mere correction, choosing rather to discard
it at once and compose a new one based either upon the same
themes or upon entirely new motives. The several overtures to
“Fidelio” are illustrations of both procedures.</p>

<p>The sketches of the greater part of Beethoven’s songs, after
the Bonn period, are preserved, and prove with what extreme
care he wrought out his melodies. The sketchbook analysed by
Nottebohm affords a curious illustration in Matthison’s “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Opferlied</span>,”
the melody being written out in full not less than six times,
the theme in substance remaining unchanged. Absolute correctness
of accent, emphasis, rhythm&mdash;of prosody, in short&mdash;was
with him a leading object; and various papers, as well as
the Conversation Books, attest his familiarity with metrical
signs and his scrupulous obedience to metrical laws. Since the
shameful mutilation and dispersion of Beethoven’s manuscripts
at the time of their sale, probably no one person has been able
to trace and examine half of the sketchbooks; still, enough have
come under observation during the researches for this work to
establish with reasonable certainty these points:</p>

<p>I. That each sketchbook was filled in pretty regular course
from beginning to end before a new one was taken.</p>

<p>II. That had the collection been kept entire it would have
afforded the means of determining with a good degree of certainty
the chronology of most of his instrumental works, after coming
to Vienna, as to their first conception and studies&mdash;excluding,
of course, those which, in one form or another, he brought with
him from Bonn.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span></p>

<p>III. That the more important vocal compositions were
studied separately.</p>

<p>IV. That only from the sketchbooks can an adequate idea of
the vast fertility of Beethoven’s genius be formed. They are
in music, like Hawthorne’s “Notebooks” in literature, the record
of a never ceasing flow of new thoughts and ideas, until death
sealed the fountain forever. There are themes and hints, never
used, for all kinds of instrumental compositions, from the trifles,
which he called “Bagatelles,” to symphonies, evidently intended
to be as different from those we know as they are from each other;
and these hints are in such numbers, that those which can be
traced in the published works are perhaps much the smaller
proportion of the whole. Whoever has the will and opportunity
to devote an hour or two to an examination of a few of these
monuments of Beethoven’s inventive genius, will easily comprehend
the remark which he made near the close of his life: “It
seems to me that I have just begun to compose!”<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Symptoms of Approaching Deafness</span></div>

<p>One topic more demands brief notice before closing this
chapter. In the “Merrymaking of the Countryfolk” of Beethoven’s
“Pastoral” Symphony, at the point where the fun grows
most fast and furious and the excitement rises to its height, an
ominous sound, as of distant thunder, gives the first faint warning
of the coming storm. So in the life of the composer at the
moment of that highest success and prosperity, which we have
labored to place vividly before the mind of the reader, just when
he could first look forward with well-grounded confidence to the
noblest gratification of a musician’s honorable ambition, a new
and discordant element thrust itself into the harmony of his life.
This was the symptoms of approaching deafness. His own
account fixes their appearance in the year 1799; then they were
still so feeble and intermittent, as to have caused him at first no
serious anxiety; but in another year they had assumed so much the
appearance of a chronic and increasing evil, as to compel him to
abandon plans for travel which he had formed, and for which he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
preparing himself, with great industry and perseverance, to appear in
the twofold capacity of virtuoso and composer. Instead, therefore,
in 1801, of having “long since journeyed through half the world,”
he, for two years, had been confined to Vienna or its immediate
vicinity, vainly seeking relief from surgeons and physicians.</p>

<p>It is not difficult to imagine calamities greater than that
which now threatened Beethoven&mdash;as, the loss of sight to a Raphael
or Rubens in the height of their fame and powers; a partial
paralysis or other incurable disease of the brain cutting short the
career of a Shakespeare or Goethe, a Bacon or Kant, a Newton
or Humboldt. Better the untimely fate of a Buckle, than to
live long years of unavailing regret over the blasted hopes and
promise of early manhood. In such cases there remains no
resource; hope itself is dead. But to Beethoven, even if his
worst fears should prove prophetic and his infirmity at length
close all prospects of a career as virtuoso and conductor, the field
of composition still remained open. This he knew, and it saved
him from utter despair. Who can say that the world has not
been a gainer by a misfortune which stirred the profoundest
depths of his being and compelled the concentration of all his
powers into one direction?</p>

<p>As the disease made progress and the prospect of relief became
less, notwithstanding a grief and anxiety which caused him such
mental agony as even to induce the thought of suicide, he so well
succeeded in keeping it concealed from all but a few intimate
and faithful friends, that no notice whatever is to be found of
it until 1802 except in papers from his own hand. They form
a very touching contrast to his letters to other correspondents.
Neither the head nor the heart is to be envied of the man who
can read them without emotion. The two most important are
letters to Wegeler giving full details of his case; doubly valuable
because they are not merely letters to a friend, but an elaborate
account of the symptoms and medical treatment of his disease,
made to a physician of high standing who thoroughly understood
the constitution of the patient. They are therefore alike
significant for what they contain and for what they omit. No
hypothesis as to the cause of the evil can be entertained, which
is discordant with them. Reserving them, however, for their
proper places in the order of time, a story or two inconsistent
with them may here be disposed of.</p>

<p>The so-called Fischoff Manuscript says:</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Theories as to the Loss of Hearing</span></div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In the year 1796, Beethoven, on a hot summer day, came greatly
overheated to his home, threw open doors and windows, disrobed down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
to his trousers and cooled himself in a draft at the open window. The
consequence was a dangerous sickness which, on his convalescence, settled
in his organs of hearing, and from this time his deafness steadily increased.</p></div>

<p>In this passage both the date and the averment are irreconcilable
with the letters to Wegeler.</p>

<p>Dr. Weissenbach, in his “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Reise zum Congress</span>” (1814), gives
what appears to be the same story but in fewer words. “He
(Beethoven) once endured a fearful attack of typhus. From
this time dates the decay of his nervous system, and probably
also the, to him, great misfortune of the loss of hearing.” Neither
a typhus nor a typhoid fever is a matter of a few days or weeks
if severe; and the chronology of our narrative is, to say the least,
so far fixed and certain as to exclude the possibility of his having
passed through any very serious illness of that nature since he
came to Vienna. But it is not at all improbable that, in 1784
or 1785, he may have been a victim to this frightful disorder,
and that it may have been the cause of his melancholy condition
of health at the time of his mother’s death, and of the chronic
diarrhœa with which he was so long troubled. True, there is
no record of such an illness; but that proves nothing. There is
no record that he passed through an attack of small-pox, except
that which the disease left upon his face.</p>

<p>But the most extraordinary and inexplicable account of the
origin of his deafness is that given by Beethoven himself to the
English pianist, Charles Neate, in 1815. Mr. Neate was once
urging Beethoven to visit England and mentioned as a farther
inducement the great skill of certain English physicians in treating
diseases of the ear, assuring him that he might cherish hopes
of relief. Beethoven replied in substance as follows: “No; I
have already had all sorts of medical advice. I shall never be
cured&mdash;I will tell you how it happened. I was once busy writing
an opera&mdash;</p>

<p>Neate: “Fidelio?”</p>

<p>Beethoven: “No. It was not ‘Fidelio.’ I had a very ill-tempered,
troublesome <i>primo tenore</i> to deal with. I had already
written two grand airs to the same text, with which he was dissatisfied,
and now a third which, upon trial, he seemed to approve and
took away with him. I thanked the stars that I was at length
rid of him and sat down immediately to a work which I had
laid aside for those airs and which I was anxious to finish. I
had not been half an hour at work, when I heard a knock at my
door, which I at once recognized as that of my <i>primo tenore</i>. I
sprang up from my table under such an excitement of rage, that,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
as the man entered the room, I threw myself upon the floor as
they do upon the stage (here B. spread out his arms and made
a gesture of illustration), coming down upon my hands. When
I arose I found myself deaf and have been so ever since. The
physicians say, the nerve is injured.”</p>

<p>That Beethoven really related this strange story cannot be
questioned; the word of the venerable Charles Neate to the
author is sufficient on that point. What is to be thought of it,
is a very different matter. Here at least it may stand without
comment.</p>

<p>It is not easy to conceive upon what ground the opinion
became current, as it did, that Beethoven in the year 1800 and
for several years to come was still burdened with the support of
his brothers&mdash;young men now respectively in their 26th and 24th
years. This mistake as to Johann has already been exposed.
Leaving Ludwig for the first quarter of this year doubly busy&mdash;having,
in addition to his usual occupations, his preparations to
make for a grand concert in April&mdash;we turn, for a page, to his
brother Carl.</p>

<p>In the “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Hof- und Staats-Schematismus</span>” for the year 1800,
at the end of the list of persons employed in the “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">K. K. Universal-Staatschuldenkasse</span>”
are the names of two “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Praktikanten</span>”; the
first is “Mr. Carl v. Beethoven lives in the Sterngasse, 484.”
In the same publication appears a new department or bureau
of the above-named office called the “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">K. K. n. öst. Klassen-Steuer-Kasse</span>”
and the second of the three bureau officers is “Mr. Carl v.
Beethoven lives unterm Tuchladen, 605.”</p>

<p>It is not improbable that, while simply “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Praktikant</span>,” he
may have needed occasional pecuniary aid, but his preferment
to the place of “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Kassa-Officier</span>” rendered him independent. This
appointment is dated March 24th, 1800, and gave him a salary
of 250 florins. Small as the sum now appears, it was amply
sufficient, with what he could earn by teaching music (and the
brother of the great Beethoven could have no lack of pupils),
to enable him to live comfortably. In fact, he was better off
than many a colleague in the public service, who still with care
and economy managed to live respectably. It may therefore
be confidently asserted that Beethoven was henceforth relieved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
of all care on account of Carl, as of Johann, until the bankruptcy
of the government and Carl’s broken health many years later,
made fraternal assistance indispensable.</p>

<p>At the beginning of this year Carl had tried his fortune as a
composer&mdash;but probably with slender profit, since no second
venture has been discovered. Six minuets, six “Deutsche” and
six contradances by him are advertised in the “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Wiener Zeitung</span>”
of January 11, in double editions, one for clavier and one for
two violins and violoncello. The concert for which Beethoven
had been preparing during the winter took place on the 2d of
April. It was his first public appearance for his own benefit in
Vienna, and, so far as is known, anywhere except in Prague.
All that is now to be ascertained in relation to it is contained in
the advertisement, in the programme, and in a single notice,
sent to the “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Allgemeine Musikalische Zeitung</span>.” The programme,
which was in the possession of Madame van Beethoven (widow
of the composer’s nephew) is as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>To-day, Wednesday, April 2nd, 1800, Herr <i>Ludwig van Beethoven</i>
will have the honor to give a grand concert for his benefit in the Royal
Imperial Court Theatre beside the Burg. The pieces which will be
performed are the following:</p>

<p>1. A grand symphony by the late Chapelmaster Mozart.</p>

<p>2. An aria from “The Creation” by the Princely Chapelmaster Herr
Haydn, sung by Mlle. Saal.</p>

<p>3. A grand Concerto for the Pianoforte, played and composed by Herr
<i>Ludwig van Beethoven</i>.</p>

<p>4. A Septet, most humbly and obediently dedicated to Her Majesty
the Empress, and composed by Herr <i>Ludwig van Beethoven</i> for four
stringed and three wind-instruments, played by Messrs. Schuppanzigh,
Schreiber, Schindlecker, Bär, Nickel, Matauschek and Dietzel.</p>

<p>5. A Duet from Haydn’s “Creation,” sung by Mr. and Mlle. Saal.</p>

<p>6. Herr <i>Ludwig van Beethoven</i> will improvise on the pianoforte.</p>

<p>7. A new grand symphony with complete orchestra, composed by Herr
<i>Ludwig van Beethoven</i>.</p>

<p>Tickets for boxes and stalls are to be had of Herr van Beethoven at
his lodgings in the Tiefen Graben, No. 241, third storey, and of the
box-keeper.</p>

<p class="center">Prices of admission are as usual.</p>

<p class="center">The beginning is at half-past 6 o’clock.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span></p>

<p>The correspondent of the “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Allgemeine Musikalische Zeitung</span>”
described the concert as the most interesting affair of its kind
given for a long time, said the new concerto had “many beauties,
especially in the first two movements,” praised the “taste and
feeling” exhibited in the Septet, and in the Symphony found
“much art, novelty and wealth of ideas”; but, he continues:
“unfortunately there was too much use of the wind-instruments,
so that the music sounded more as if written for a military band
than an orchestra.” The rest of the notice is devoted to scolding
the band for inattention to the conductor. Which of the pianoforte
Concertos Beethoven played on this occasion is nowhere
intimated. The Symphony in C soon became known throughout
Germany; while the Septet achieved a sudden popularity so
widely extended and enduring as at length to become an annoyance
to the composer.<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">A Public Concert with Punto</span></div>

<p>Before the month was out Beethoven again played in public
in a concert given by Johann Stich, known as Punto. This
Bohemian virtuoso, after several years of wandering, had lately
come to Vienna from Paris, <i>via</i> Munich. As a performer upon
the horn he was unrivalled by any predecessor or contemporary;
but as a composer he was beneath criticism. Beethoven’s delight
in any one whose skill afforded him new experience of the powers
and possible effects of any orchestral instrument is known to the
reader. Nothing more natural, therefore, than his readiness to
compose a sonata for himself and Punto to be played at the
latter’s concert on April 18th. Ries informs us that “though the
concert was announced with the Sonata the latter was not yet
begun. Beethoven began the work the day before the performance
and it was ready for the concert.” His habit of merely
sketching his own part and of trusting to his memory and the
inspiration of the moment, even when producing his grand Concertos
in public, probably rendered him good service on this occasion.
The “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Allgemeine Musikzeitung</span>” (III, 704) preserves also
the interesting fact that owing to the enthusiastic applause the
Sonata was immediately repeated.</p>

<p>April 27th was the anniversary of the day on which
Maximilian Franz entered Bonn to assume the duties of Elector
and Archbishop. Sixteen years had passed and on this day he,
with a small retinue, again entered Vienna. He took refuge “in
an Esterhazy villa in a suburb,” while the small château near<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
which now stands the railway station at Hetzendorf, behind
Schönbrunn Garden, was preparing for his residence; whither he
soon removed, and where for the present we leave him.</p>

<p>At the end of February or early in March, the charlatan
Daniel Steibelt gave a concert in Prague which brought him in
1800 florins, and in April or May, “having finished his speculation,
he went to Vienna, his purse filled with ducats, where he was
knocked in the head by the pianist Beethoven,” says Tomaschek.
Ries relates how:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>When Steibelt came to Vienna with his great name, some of Beethoven’s
friends grew alarmed lest he do injury to the latter’s reputation.
Steibelt did not visit him; they met first time one evening at the house
of Count Fries, where Beethoven produced his new Trio in B-flat major
for Pianoforte, Clarinet and Violoncello (Op.&nbsp;11), for the first time.<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a>
There is no opportunity for particular display on the part of the pianist
in this Trio. Steibelt listened to it with a sort of condescension, uttered
a few compliments to Beethoven and felt sure of his victory. He played
a Quintet of his own composition, improvised, and made a good deal of
effect with his tremolos, which were then something entirely new. Beethoven
could not be induced to play again. A week later there was
again a concert at Count Fries’s; Steibelt again played a quintet which
had a good deal of success. He also played an improvisation (which
had, obviously, been carefully prepared) and chose the same theme on
which Beethoven had written variations in his Trio.<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> This incensed
the admirers of Beethoven and him; he had to go to the pianoforte and
improvise. He went in his usual (I might say, ill-bred) manner to
the instrument as if half-pushed, picked up the violoncello part of
Steibelt’s quintet in passing, placed it (intentionally?) upon the stand
upside down and with one finger drummed a theme out of the first few
measures. Insulted and angered he improvised in such a manner that
Steibelt left the room before he finished, would never again meet him
and, indeed, made it a condition that Beethoven should not be invited
before accepting an offer.</p></div>

<p>It was, and still is, the custom at Vienna for all whose vocations
and pecuniary circumstances render it possible, to spend
all or some portion of the summer months in the country.
The aristocracies of birth and wealth retire to their country-seats,
live in villas for the season or join the throngs at the great watering-places;
other classes find refuge in the villages and hamlets
which abound in the lovely environs of the city, where many a
neat cottage is built for their use and where the peasants generally
have a spare room or two, cleanly kept and neatly furnished.
Beethoven’s habit of escaping from town during the hot months<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
was, therefore, nothing peculiar to him. We have reached the
point whence, with little if any interruption, Beethoven can be
followed from house to house, in city and country, through the
rest of his life; a matter of great value in fixing the true dates of
important letters and determining the chronology of his life and
works&mdash;but for the first seven years the record is very incomplete.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Various Dwelling Places in Vienna</span></div>

<p>Carl Holz told Jahn: “He (Beethoven) lived at first in a
little attic-room in the house of the book-binder Strauss in the
Alservorstadt, where he had a miserable time.” This is one
of the facts which an inquisitive young man like Holz would
naturally learn of the master during the short period when he
was his factotum. This attic-room must have been soon changed
for the room “on the ground-floor” mentioned in a previous
chapter. An undated note of van Swieten is directed to Beethoven
at “No. 45 Alsergasse, at Prince Lichnowsky’s”; but in the
Vienna directory for 1804 no street is so named, and the only
number 45 in the “Alsergrund” is in the Lämmelgasse, property of
Georg Musial; but Prince Josef Lichnowsky is named as owner
of No. 125 in the Hauptstrasse of that suburb. This was the
same house; it had merely changed numbers. The site is now
occupied by the house No. 30 Alserstrasse. Thence Beethoven
went as a guest to the house occupied by Prince Lichnowsky.
In May, 1795, Beethoven, in advertising the Trios, Op.&nbsp;1, gives
the “residence of the author” as the “Ogylisches Haus in the Kreuzgasse
behind the Minorite church, No. 35 in the first storey”;
but that is no reason to think that Prince Lichnowsky then lived
there. Where Beethoven was during the next few years has not
been ascertained, but, as has been seen by the concert bill on a
preceding page, he was during the winter of 1799-1800 in the
Tiefen Graben “in a very high and narrow house,” as Czerny
wrote to F. Luib.<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> For the summer of 1800, he took quarters
for himself and servant in one of those houses in Unter-Döbling,
an hour’s walk, perhaps, from town, to which the readiest access
is by the bridge over the brook on the North side of the Döbling
hospital for the insane. The wife of a distinguished Vienna
advocate occupied with her children another part of the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
house. One of these children was Grillparzer, afterward famous
as a poet. The zeal with which Beethoven at this period labored
to perfect his pianoforte playing, and his dislike to being listened
to, have been already noted. Madame Grillparzer was a lady of
fine taste and culture, fond of music and therefore able to appreciate
the skill of her fellow-lodger, but ignorant of his aversion
to listeners. Her son, in 1861, still remembered Beethoven’s
incessant practice and his mother’s habit of standing outside her
own door to enjoy his playing. This continued for some time;
but one day Beethoven sprang from the instrument to the door,
opened it, looked out to see if any one was listening, and unfortunately
discovered the lady. From that moment he played no
more. Madame Grillparzer, thus made aware of his sensitiveness
on this point, informed him through his servant that thenceforth
her door into the common passageway should be kept
locked, and she and her family would solely use another. It
was of no avail; Beethoven played no more.</p>

<p>Another authentic and characteristic anecdote can belong
only to this summer. There lived in a house hard by a peasant
of no very good reputation, who had a daughter remarkably
beautiful, but also not of the best fame. Beethoven was greatly
captivated by her and was in the habit of stopping to gaze at
her when he passed by where she was at work in farmyard or
field. She, however, made no return of his evident liking and
only laughed at his admiration. On one occasion the father was
arrested for engaging in a brawl and imprisoned. Beethoven took
the man’s part and went to the magistrates to obtain his release.
Not succeeding, he became angry and abusive, and in the end
would have been arrested for his impertinence but for the strong
representations made by some, who knew him, of his position in
society and of the high rank, influence and power of his friends.</p>

<p>Throughout this period of Beethoven’s life, each summer is
distinguished by some noble composition, completed, or nearly
so, so that on his return to the city it was ready for revision and
his copyist. Free from the demands of society, his time was his
own; his fancy was quickened, his inspiration strengthened, in
field and forest labor was a delight. The most important work
of the master bears in his own hand the date, 1800, and may
reasonably be supposed to have been the labor of this summer.
It is the Concerto in C minor for Pianoforte and Orchestra, Op.&nbsp;37.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Doležalek and Hoffmeister</span></div>

<p>At the approach of autumn Beethoven returned to his old
quarters in the Tiefen Graben. In this year Krumpholz introduced
to him Johann Emanuel (possibly Johann Nepomuk Emanuel)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
Doležalek, a young man of 20 years, born in Chotieborz in Bohemia,
who had come to Vienna to take lessons from Albrechtsberger.
He played the pianoforte and violoncello, was a capable
musician, in his youth a rather popular composer of Bohemian
songs and then, for half a century, one of the best teachers in
the capital. Toward the close of his life he was frequently
occupied with the arrangement of private concerts, chiefly quartet
parties, for Prince Czartoryski and other prominent persons. As
long as he lived he was an enthusiastic admirer of Beethoven, and
enjoyed the friendship of the composer till his death. Among
his observations are the statements concerning the hatred of
Beethoven felt by the Vienna musicians already noted. Koželuch,
he relates, threw the C minor Trio at his (Doležalek’s) feet when
the latter played it to him. Speaking of Beethoven, Koželuch
said to Haydn: “We would have done that differently, wouldn’t
we, Papa?” and Haydn answered, smilingly, “Yes, we would
have done that differently.” Haydn, says Doležalek, could not
quite reconcile himself with Beethoven’s music. It was Doležalek
who witnessed the oft-told scene in the Swan tavern when Beethoven
insisted on paying without having eaten.</p>

<p>One of the most prolific and popular composers whom Beethoven
found in Vienna was Franz Anton Hoffmeister, “Chapelmaster
and R. I. licensed Music, Art and Book Seller.” He was
an immigrant from the Neckar valley and (born 1754) much
older than Beethoven, to whom he had extended a warm sympathy
and friendship, doubly valuable from his somewhat similar experience
as a young student in Vienna. This is evident from the
whole tone of their correspondence. In 1800, Hoffmeister left
Vienna and in Leipzig formed a copartnership with Ambrosius
Kühnel, organist of the Electoral Saxon Court Chapel, and established
a publishing house there, still retaining his business in
Vienna. As late as December 5, 1800, his signature is as above
given; but on the 1st of January, 1801, the advertisements in
the public press announce the firm of “Hoffmeister and Kühnel,
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Bureau de Musique</i> in Leipzig.” Since 1814 the firm name has
been C. F. Peters. Knowing Beethoven personally and so intimately,
it is alike creditable to the talents of the one and the
taste and appreciation of the other that Hoffmeister, immediately
upon organizing his new publishing house, should have
asked him for manuscripts. To his letter he received an answer
dated Dec. 15, 1800, in which Beethoven says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>... Per <i>primo</i> you must know that I am very sorry that you, my
dear brother in music, did not earlier let me know something (of your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
doings) so that I might have marketed my quartets with you, as well as
many other pieces which I have sold, but if Mr. Brother is as conscientious
as many other honest engravers who grave us poor composers to
death, you will know how to derive profit from them when they appear.
I will now set forth in brief what Mr. Brother can have from me. I<sup>mo</sup>
a Septet <i>per il Violino</i>, <i>Viola</i>, <i>Violoncello</i>, <i>Contrabasso</i>, <i>Clarinetto</i>, <i>Corno</i>,
<i>Fagotto</i>&mdash;<i>tutti obligati</i>. (I cannot write anything not obligato for I
came into this world with an obligato accompaniment.) This Septet
has pleased greatly. For more frequent use the three wind-instruments,
namely <i>Fagotto</i>, <i>Clarinetto</i> and <i>Corno</i> might be transcribed for another
violin, viola and violoncello. II<sup>o</sup> A grand Symphony for full orchestra.
III<sup>o</sup> A Concerto for pianoforte which I do not claim to be one of my
best, as well as another one which will be published here by Mollo (this
for the information of the Leipzig critics) because I am for the present
keeping the better ones for myself until I make a tour; but it will not
disgrace you to publish it. IV<sup>o</sup> A grand Solo Sonata.<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> That is all
that I can give you at this moment. A little later you may have a
Quintet for stringed instruments as well as, probably, Quartets and other
things which I have not now with me. In your reply you might set the
prices and as you are neither a Jew nor an Italian, nor I either one or
the other, we shall no doubt come to an understanding.</p></div>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">The First String Quartets</span></div>

<p>The reference to the Quartets, Op.&nbsp;18, in this letter, taken in
connection with the apologies for long delay in writing, indicates
conclusively enough that at least the first set, the first three,
had been placed in the hands of Mollo and Co. early in the autumn,
and it is barely possible, not probable, that they had already been
issued from the press.<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> The importance of these Quartets in the
history both of Beethoven and of chamber music renders very
desirable more definite information upon their origin and dates
of composition than the incomplete, unsatisfactory and not always
harmonious data already known, afford. The original manuscripts
appear to have been lost.</p>

<p>Von Lenz quotes in his “Critical Catalogue of Beethoven’s
Works” an anecdote from a pamphlet printed at Dorpat in which
is related:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>After Beethoven had composed his well-known String Quartet in
F major he played for his friend (Amenda) (on the pianoforte?) the
glorious <i>Adagio</i> (D minor, 9-8 time) and asked him what thought
had been awakened by it. “It pictured for me the parting of two lovers,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
was the answer. “Good!” remarked Beethoven, “I thought of the scene
in the burial vault in ‘Romeo and Juliet’.”</p></div>

<p>This Quartet existed, then, before Amenda left Vienna. Czerny
says in his notes for Jahn: “Of the first six Violin Quartets that
in D major, No. 3 in print, was the very first composed by Beethoven.
On the advice of Schuppanzigh he called that in F major
No. 1, although it was composed later.” Ries confirms this: “Of
his Violin Quartets, Op.&nbsp;18, he composed that in D major first of
all. That in F major, which now precedes it, was originally the
third.”<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> <i>Nota bene</i> that neither Czerny nor Ries spoke from personal
observation at the time of composition; they must both have
learned the fact from Beethoven himself, or, more probably, from
dates on the original manuscripts. A criticism of three quartets
which appeared in the “Allg. Mus. Zeitung” in 1799, which failed
to give the name of the composer, has been applied by some writers
(by Langhans in his History of Music, for instance) to Beethoven’s
Op.&nbsp;18; but erroneously. They were the works of Emanuel Aloys
Förster (born January 26, 1748, in Neurath, Upper Silesia, died
November 12, 1823, in Vienna), a musician who was so highly
esteemed by Beethoven that, on one occasion at least, he called
him his “old master.” The phrase can easily be interpreted to
mean that Beethoven found instruction in Förster’s chamber
music which he heard at the soirées of Prince Lichnowsky and
other art-patrons. Förster’s compositions, not many of which
have been preserved in print, are decidedly Beethovenish in character.
His eldest son, who in 1870 was still living in Trieste,
remembered Beethoven perfectly well from 1803 to 1813, and
communicated to the author of this biography some reminiscences
well worth preserving. It is known from other sources that Beethoven,
after the retirement of Albrechtsberger, considered Förster
to be the first of all the Vienna teachers of counterpoint and
composition, and this is confirmed by the son’s statement that it
was on Beethoven’s advice that he sent to press the compendious
“<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Anleitung zum Generalbass</span>” which Breitkopf and Härtel published
in 1805. A year or two later, Count Rasoumowsky applied
to Beethoven for instruction in musical theory and especially in
quartet composition. Beethoven absolutely refused, but so
strongly recommended his friend Förster, that the latter was engaged.
Förster’s dwelling in all those years was a favorite resort
of the principal composers and dilettanti. Thither came Beethoven;
Zmeskall, a very precise gentleman with abundant white<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
hair; Schuppanzigh, a short fat man with a huge belly; Weiss,
tall and thin; Linke, the lame violoncellist, Henry Eppinger, the
Jewish violin dilettante, the youthful Mayseder, J. N. Hummel,
and others. The regular periods of these quartet meetings were
Sunday at noon, and the evening of Thursday; but Beethoven
in those years often spent other evenings with Förster, “when the
conversation usually turned upon musical theory and composition.”
Notwithstanding the wide difference in their ages (22 years),
their friendship was cordial and sincere. The elder not only
appreciated and admired the genius of the younger, but honored
him as a man; and spoke of him as being not only a great musical
composer, but, however at times rough in manner and harsh, even
rude, in speech, of a most honorable and noble nature. Add
to all this the fact, that Beethoven in later years recommended
Förster to pupils as his own “old master,” and it is no forced and
unnatural inference, that he (Beethoven) had studied quartet composition
with him, as he had counterpoint with Albrechtsberger,
and operatic writing with Salieri. Nor is this inference weakened&mdash;it
is rather strengthened&mdash;by some points in what now follows:</p>

<p>The earliest mention of a string quartet in connection with
Beethoven is that proposal by Count Appony cited from Wegeler
which led to no instant result. Then comes a passage from a
letter to Amenda: “Do not give your Quartet to anybody, because
I have greatly changed it, having learned how to write quartets
properly.” Had he learned from study under Förster?</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Sketches for the First Quartets</span></div>

<p>The original manuscripts being lost, further chronological
notices concerning them must be sought for in the sketchbooks.
Here Nottebohm comes to our assistance. In the Petter collection
at Vienna there are sketches for the last movement of the
G major Quartet, the last movement of the B-flat Quartet (among
them one which was discarded), both deviating from the printed
form more or less, and one for the last movement of the F major
Quartet, this approaching pretty closely the ultimate form; thus
this quartet was farther advanced than the others. Associated
with this sketch are sketches for the Sonata in B-flat, Op.&nbsp;22, and
for the easy Variations in G major which were begun while work
was in progress on the last movement of the Quartet in G. Beethoven
worked simultaneously on the first movement of Op.&nbsp;22
and the scherzo of the first Quartet; while working on the last
movement of the Quartet in B-flat the rondo of the Sonata was
begun. The sketches date from 1799 and 1800. Inasmuch as
they occur before those for the Horn Sonata, which was composed
very hurriedly and performed on April 18, 1800, the sketches<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
were doubtless written earlier. One of the variations of the
Quartet in A major was sketched much earlier&mdash;in 1794 or 1795.
A little sketch for the first movement of the F major Quartet found
beside sketches for the Violin Sonata, Op.&nbsp;24, no doubt belongs
to the revised form of the Quartet. In a sketchbook formerly
in the possession of Grassnick in Berlin, there are sketches for
the Quartet in D major which are near the ultimate form, except
that there is a different theme for the last movement. Then
comes a beginning in G major inscribed “Quartet 2,” the germ of
the theme of the second Quartet. There was, therefore, at the
time no second Quartet, and that in D is the first. There follows
“<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Der Kuss</span>,” sketches for the “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Opferlied</span>,” the Rondo in G major,
Op.&nbsp;51, No. 2, to a passage from Schiller’s “Ode to Joy,” to Gellert’s
“<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Meine Lebenszeit verstreicht</span>,” in G minor, to an intermezzo for
pianoforte, to the revised form of the B-flat Concerto (which he
played in Prague in 1798), and to various songs. The indications
are, therefore, that the sketches were written in 1798. Then
come sketches for the variations on “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Anleitung zum Generalbass</span>,”
which originated and were published in the beginning of 1799, and
after them extended sketches for the first movement of the F
major Quartet, of which those belonging to the first movement are
in an advanced stage, those for the second movement less so. A
few sketches for a “third” quartet (thus specified) which were
not used show that there was no third at the time; therefore, the
Quartet in F is the second and was planned in 1799. Another
sketchbook contains the continuation of the sketches for the F
major Quartet, and, indeed, for all the movements; then an unused
sketch for a “third” quartet (still not yet in existence), then to two
songs by Goethe (one “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Ich denke dein</span>”), then to the movements
of the G major Quartet, which is thus indicated to have been the
third (the intermezzo in the second movement was conceived
later), further sketches for the A major Quartet, which, it follows,
was the fourth. Among these sketches are others for the Septet
and the Variations on “Kind, willst du ruhig schlafen?” which
appeared in December in 1799, and was therefore not composed
earlier. All these sketches date from 1798 and 1799; but the
Quartets were not finished. In an unused sketch for the Adagio
of the quartet in F occur the words: “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Les derniers soupirs</span>,” which
confirm the story told by Amenda. The continuation of the G
major Quartet dates to 1800. Up to now no sketches for the
Quartet in C minor have been found.</p>

<p>The results of this chronological investigation may be summed
up as follows: The composition of the Quartets was begun in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
1798, that in D, the third, being first undertaken. This was
followed by that in F and soon after, or simultaneously, work was
begun on that in G, which was originally designed as the second;
but, as that in F was completed earlier, this was designated as
the second by Beethoven, and that in G became in point of time
the third. The Quartet in F was finished in its original shape by
June 25, 1799, on which day he gave it to Amenda; he revised
it later. Whether or not this was also done with the others cannot
be said; there is no evidence. The remark made in 1801,
that he had just learned to write quartets, need not be read as
meaning that he had formal instruction from Förster, but is
amply explained by his practice on the six Quartets; yet Förster
may have influenced him strongly. He then wrote the one in A
(now No. 5), intending it to be the fourth; in this he seems to
have made use of a <i>motif</i> invented at an earlier period. The
Quartets in B-flat and C minor followed, the latter being, perhaps,
the last. The definitive elaboration of the Quartets lasted certainly
until 1800, possibly until 1801. The Quartets then appeared
in two sets from the press of Mollo. It is likely that the first three,
at least, were in the hands of the publisher before the end of 1800,
as is proved by the letter to Hoffmeister. The first three appeared
in the summer of 1801 and were advertised as on sale by Nägeli
in Zurich already in July; they were mentioned in the “Allg.
Musik. Zeitung” on August 26, and in Spazier’s “Zeitung für die
Elegante Welt.” In October of the same year the last three
appeared and Mollo advertised them in the “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Wiener Zeitung</span>”
of October 28. The Quartets are dedicated to Prince Lobkowitz.</p>

<p>Notice of a valuable present to Beethoven from his lenient
and generous patron, Prince Carl Lichnowsky, naturally connects
itself with the story of the Quartets&mdash;a gift thus described
by Alois Fuchs, formerly violinist in the Imperial Court Orchestra,
under date of December 2, 1846:</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Beethoven’s Quartet of Instruments</span></div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Ludwig van Beethoven owned a complete quartet of excellent
Italian instruments given to him by his princely patron and friend
Lichnowsky at the suggestion of the famous quartet-player Schuppanzigh.
I am in a position to describe each of the instruments in detail.</p>

<p>1. A violin made by Joseph Guarnerius in Cremona in the year
1718 is now in the possession of Mr. Karl Holz, director of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Concerts
spirituels</i> in Vienna.</p>

<p>2. The second violin (which was offered for sale) was made by
Nicholas Amati in the year 1667, and was in the possession of Dr. Ohmeyer,
who died recently in Hütteldorf; it has been purchased by Mr. Huber.</p>

<p>3. The viola, made by Vincenzo Ruger in 1690, is also the property
of Mr. Karl Holz.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span></p>

<p>4. The violoncello, an Andreas Guarnerius of the year 1712, is
in the possession of Mr. P. Wertheimber of Vienna.</p>

<p>The seal of Beethoven has been impressed under the neck of each
instrument and on the back of each Beethoven scratched a big B, probably
for the purpose of protecting himself against an exchange. The
instruments are all well preserved and in good condition. The most
valuable one, without question, is the violin by Joseph Guarnerius, which
is distinguished by extraordinary power of tone, for which, indeed, Mr.
Holz has refused an offer of 1000 florins.</p></div>

<p>The four instruments were bought by Peter Th. Jokits in
1861, who gave them to the Royal Library at Berlin. Beethoven
received them from Lichnowsky certainly before 1802, but in
what year is unknown.<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> Another proof of the Prince’s regard
and generosity, however, belongs to this, namely, an annuity of
600 florins to be continued until the composer should find some
suitable permanent employment.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The only known publication of the year 1800 is the Rondo
in G major, Op.&nbsp;51, No. 2, which came from the press of Simrock.
As for the compositions of the year it is safe to assume that Beethoven
put the finishing touches to the first Symphony, the Septet,
Op.&nbsp;20, and the Quartets, Op.&nbsp;18. Furthermore, there can be
little doubt but that the Sonata for Horn, Op.&nbsp;17, the Pianoforte
Sonata, Op.&nbsp;22, the Concerto in C minor, and the Variations for
Four Hands on the melody of the song “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Ich denke dein</span>,” belong
to this year. The “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Variations très faciles</span>” on an original theme
in G were sketched and probably completed. The only chronological
clues to the Horn Sonata are the date of its first performance,
April 18, 1800, and the anecdote by Ries concerning the rapid
completion of the work. No sketches have been found and nothing
is known of the autograph; but according to Nottebohm the
beginning of a clean copy of the Adagio is to be found among
the sketches for the Sonatas Op.&nbsp;22 and 23. Punto was still in
Munich in 1800, and since the work seems assuredly to have
been designed for him, there is equal certainty that it was composed
in that year. It was published by Mollo in March, 1801.
The Septet, for four strings and three wind-instruments, dedicated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
to the Empress Maria Theresia, was played at the concert at which
the Symphony in C major was brought forward, April 2, 1800;
but it had been heard previously in the house of Prince Schwarzenberg.
Inasmuch as sketches for it are found among those for
the Quartets, specially the one in A major, which belong to the
year 1799, its inception may be placed in that year, though it
was probably finished in 1800 shortly before its performance.
There is no date on the autograph. It was offered to Hoffmeister
in the letter of December 15, 1800, and was published by him in
1802. The Septet speedily won great popularity and was frequently
transcribed. Hoffmeister had an arrangement for string
quintet which he advertised on August 18, 1802. Ries thought
that Beethoven had made it, but he was in error; nevertheless,
Beethoven gave Hoffmeister permission to publish an arrangement
in which strings were substituted for the wind-instruments,
and himself transcribed it as a pianoforte trio with violin or
clarinet <i>ad lib</i>. This arrangement was made as a tribute of gratitude
from the composer to his new physician, Dr. Johann Schmidt.
The doctor played the violin and his daughter the pianoforte,
both fairly well, and Beethoven arranged his popular piece for
family use and, as was customary at the time, gave Dr. Schmidt
the exclusive possession of the music for a year.<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a></p>

<p>The theme of the minuet in the Septet was borrowed from
the Pianoforte Sonata, Op.&nbsp;49, No. 2, but its treatment is original.
There has been considerable controversy without absolutely definitive
result touching the melody which is varied in the Andante.
Kretschmer, in his “Deutsche Volkslieder” (Berlin, 1838; Vol. I,
No. 102, p. 181), prints the melody in connection with a Rhenish
folksong (“Ach Schiffer, lieber Schiffer”), and there is a tradition
that Czerny said that it was taken by Beethoven from that
source. Nottebohm offers evidence deserving of consideration
that the melody is a folktune; but Ries and Wegeler, who lived
on the Rhine, had nothing to say on the subject. Erk and Böhme
(“Deutscher Liederhort,” Vol. I, p. 273) publish folksongs dealing
with the legend which is at the base of “Ach Schiffer, lieber
Schiffer,” but the melody of the Andante is not to be found among
them, and Böhme gives it as his opinion that the song printed
by Kretschmer was written to Beethoven’s melody by Kretschmer’s
collaborator Zuccalmaglio. It is not likely that the melody,
had it lived in the mouths of the people, would have escaped so
industrious a collector as Erk, who, moreover, was a native of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
the Rhine country. The evidence would seem to indicate that
the melody was original with Beethoven.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Compositions Sketched in 1800</span></div>

<p>The Pianoforte Sonata in B-flat, Op.&nbsp;22, also belongs to this
year, as appears from the fact that it was offered to Hoffmeister
in the letter of December 15. It was still in an unfinished state
on the completion of the Sonata for Horn, as is shown by the
circumstance that sketches of it are mingled with a fair transcript
of a passage from the latter work. There are also sketches for
Op.&nbsp;22, among those for the Quartet in B-flat, Op.&nbsp;18, No. 6, and
the later movements of the Quartet in F&mdash;no doubt the revision.
The sketches therefore belong to the year 1800, but may date
back to 1799, from which it would appear that Beethoven worked
an unusually long time on the Sonata. The principal labor was
performed most likely in the summer of 1800, which Beethoven
spent at Unterdöbling. It was published in 1802 by Hoffmeister
and Kühnel. Sketches from the “Six Easy Variations” are found
amongst some for the last movement of the Quartet in G, which
seem to be nearly finished. Again we can fix the year as 1799 or
1800. Of special importance is the fact that the theme of the
Variations is the same as the first episode of the rondo of the
Sonata in B-flat, and the circumstance that the sketches are of
almost the same date indicates that the identity was not accidental.
The Variations were advertised as new by Traeg on December
16, 1800.</p>

<p>The Variations in D for four hands on the melody of Goethe’s
poem, “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Ich denke dein</span>,” were conceived at practically the same
time as those just described. Beethoven at first intended to
give each stanza a separate setting, and to this end made two
sketches, which are associated with the Quartet sketches and
belong to the year 1799. He then took the melody of the first
stanza as a theme for variations for four hands in the same year
and wrote them into the autograph album of two sisters, the
countesses Therese Brunswick and Josephine Deym. On September
22, 1803, he offered them to Hoffmeister in the place of the
Trio Variations, Op.&nbsp;44, with the remark that he considered them
better than the latter. Hoffmeister, however, published the Trio
Variations (in 1804). The Variations in D were not published
until the beginning of 1805, and were described as having been
written in 1800 for the two countesses mentioned, and dedicated
to them.</p>

<p>An autograph preserved in the Royal Library in Berlin
contains four of the variations on “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Ich denke dein</span>,” an Adagio
in F major noted on four staves (three with treble, one with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
bass clef), a Scherzo in G major, &frac34; time, and an Allegro in G
major, 2/4. Albert Kopfermann, who published the Adagio for
the first time in No. 12, Vol. I, of “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Die Musik</span>,” considers, no doubt
correctly, that the three compositions were written for an automatic
musical instrument. Though the number of new compositions
produced in 1800 was small, attention must be directed
to the fact that the revision and completion of works for publication,
together with the planning of new works, gave a deal of
occupation to Beethoven. Amongst the compositions made
ready for the printer were the Quartets, which were not ready
till near the end of the year. To them must be added the Sonata
in E-flat, Op.&nbsp;27, No. 1, and the Concerto in C minor, the autograph
of which distinctly bears the date 1800. It is certain,
moreover, that Beethoven began working on “Prometheus” in
this year, and the summer must have been a busy one for him.</p>

<p>The tone of Beethoven’s correspondence and the many proofs
of his untiring industry during the winter 1800-1 and early
part of the succeeding spring, suggest a mind at ease, rejoicing
in the exercise of its powers, and a body glowing with vigorous
health. But for his own words to Wegeler: “I have been really
miserable this winter,” the passing allusions to ill health in his
replies to Hoffmeister’s letters would merely impress the reader as
being half-groundless apologies for lack of punctuality in writing.
This chapter will exhibit the young master both as he appeared to
the public and as he showed himself in confidential intercourse
to the few in whose presence he put aside the mask and laid open
his heart; and will, therefore, it is believed, be found fully to
justify what has been said of his heroic energy, courage and
endurance under a trouble of no ordinary nature.</p>

<p>In the beginning of the year he wrote to Hoffmeister<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> as
follows under date “January 15 (or thereabouts), 1801”:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>... Your enterprises delight me also and I wish that if works
of art ever bring profit that it might go to real artists instead of mere
shopkeepers.</p>

<p>The fact that you purpose to publish the works of <i>Sebastian Bach</i>
does good to my heart which beats only for the lofty and magnificent
art of this patriarch of harmony, and I hope soon to see them in vigorous
sale. I hope, as soon as golden peace has been declared, to be helpful in
many ways, especially if you offer the works for subscription.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span></p>

<p>As regards our real business, since you ask it I meet your wishes
by offering you the following items: Septet (concerning which I have
already written you), 20 ducats; Symphony, 20 ducats; Grand Solo
Sonata&mdash;Allegro, Adagio, Minuetto, Rondo&mdash;20 ducats. This Sonata
is a tidy piece of work (<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">hat sich gewaschen</i>), my dearest Mr. Brother.</p>

<p>Now for an explanation: You will wonder, perhaps, that I have
made no distinction here between Sonata, Septet and Symphony. I
have done this because I have learned that a septet or symphony has a
smaller sale than a sonata, though a symphony ought unquestionably to
be worth more. (N. B. The Septet consists of a short introductory <i>Adagio</i>,
then <i>Allegro</i>, <i>Adagio</i>, <i>Minuetto</i>, <i>Andante</i> with variations, <i>Minuetto</i> again,
a short <i>Adagio</i> introduction and then <i>Presto</i>.) I put the price of the
Concerto at only 10 ducats because, as I have already written, I do not
give it out as one of my best. I do not think the amount excessive on
the whole; I have tried, at least, to make the price as moderate as possible
for you. As regards the bill of exchange you may, since you leave
the matter to me, issue it to Geimüller or Schüller. The whole sum
amounts to 70 ducats for the four works. I do not understand any
money except Viennese ducats; how many thalers in gold that amounts
to does not concern me, I being a really bad negotiator and mathematician.</p>

<p>This disposes of the disagreeable (<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">saure</i>) business; I call it so
because I wish things were different in the world. There ought to be
only one art warehouse in the world to which an artist would only need
to carry his art-works to take away with him whatever he needed; as
it is one must be half tradesman; and how we adjust ourselves&mdash;good
God!&mdash;that is what I again call disagreeable. As regards the L... O...,<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a>
let them talk; they will certainly never make anybody immortal by
their twaddle, and as little will they rob anybody of immortality to
whom Apollo has decreed it.</p></div>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Benefit Concerts for Wounded Soldiers</span></div>

<p>The next letter requires a word of introduction. That military
campaign which included the disastrous field of Hohenlinden
(December 3, 1800), had filled the hospitals at Vienna, and among
the various means of raising funds for the benefit of the wounded,
was a series of public concerts. The two in which they reached
their climax took place in the large Ridotto room (<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Redouten-Saal</i>)
of the imperial palace. The one arranged by Baron von Braun
as Director of the Court Opera, was a performance of Haydn’s
“Creation” conducted by the composer, on January 16th; the
other was arranged by Mme. Frank (Christine Gerhardi) for
January 30th. That lady, Mme. Galvani (Magdalena Willmann)
and Herr Simoni were the singers, Beethoven and Punto the
instrumental solo performers; Haydn directed two of his own
symphonies, Paër and Conti directed the orchestra in the accompaniments
to the vocal music. In the first public announcement
printed in the “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Wiener Zeitung</span>” the only artist mentioned was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
“the famous amateur singer Frau von Frank, <i>née</i> Gerhardi,” as
the giver of the concert. This called out from Beethoven the
following letter:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="salut">
Pour Madame de Frank.
</p>

<p>I think it my duty, best of women, to ask you not to permit
your husband again in the second announcement of our concert to forget
that those who contribute their talents to the same also be made known
to the public. This is the custom, and I do not see if it is not done what
is to increase the attendance at the concert, which is its chief aim. Punto
is not a little wrought up about the matter, and he is right, and it was my
intention even before I saw him to remind you of what must have been
the result of great haste or great forgetfulness. Look after this, best
of women, since if it is not done dissatisfaction will surely result.</p>

<p>Having been convinced, not only by myself but by others as well,
that I am not a useless factor in this concert, I know that not only I but
Punto, Simoni, Galvani will ask that the public be informed also of our
zeal for the philanthropic purposes of this concert; otherwise we must
all conclude that we are useless.</p>

<p class="sig">
Wholly yours<br />
L. v. Bthvn.</p></div>

<p>Whether this sharp remonstrance produced the desired effect
cannot now be ascertained, but the original advertisement was
repeated in the newspaper on the 24th and 28th <i>verbatim</i>.</p>

<p>In the state of affairs then existing it was no time to give
public concerts for private emolument; moreover, a quarrel with
the orchestra a year before might have prevented Beethoven
from obtaining the Burgtheater again, and the new Theater-an-der-Wien
was not yet ready for occupation; but there is still
another adequate reason for his giving no <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Akademie</i> (concert)
this spring. He had been engaged to compose an important
work for the court stage.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Vigano and the Prometheus Ballet</span></div>

<p>Salvatore Vigano, dancer and composer of ballets, both action
and music, the son of a Milanese of the same profession, was born
at Naples, March 29, 1769. He began his career at Rome, taking
female parts because women were not allowed there to appear
upon the stage. He then had engagements successively at Madrid&mdash;where
he married Maria Medina, a celebrated Spanish danseuse&mdash;Bordeaux,
London and Venice, in which last city, in 1791, he
composed his “Raoul, Sire de Croqui.” Thence he came to
Vienna, where he and his wife first appeared in May, 1793. His
“Raoul” was produced on June 25th at the Kärnthnerthor-Theater.
After two years of service here he accepted engagements in five
continental cities and returned to Vienna again in 1799. The
second wife of Emperor Franz, Maria Theresia, was a woman of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
much and true musical taste and culture, and Vigano determined
to compliment her in a ballet composed expressly for that purpose.
Haydn’s gloriously successful “Creation” may, perhaps,
have had an influence in the choice of a subject, “The Men of
Prometheus,” and the dedication of Beethoven’s Septet to the
Empress may have had its effect in the choice of a composer.
At all events, the work was entrusted to Beethoven.</p>

<p>If the manner in which this work has been neglected by
Beethoven’s biographers and critics may be taken as a criterion,
an opinion prevails that it was not worthy of him in subject,
execution or success. It seems to be forgotten that as an orchestral
composer he was then known only by two or three pianoforte
concertos and his first Symphony&mdash;a work which by no means
rivals the greater production of Mozart and Haydn&mdash;and that
for the stage he was not known to have written anything. There
is a misconception, too, as to the position which the ballet just
then held in the Court Theatre. As a matter of fact it stood
higher than ever before and, perhaps, than it has ever stood since.
Vigano was a man of real genius and had wrought a reform which
is clearly, vigorously and compendiously described in a memoir
of Heinrich von Collin, from which we quote:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In the reign of Leopold II the ballet, which had become a well-attended
entertainment in Vienna through the efforts of Noverre, was
restored to the stage. Popular interest turned at once to them again,
and this was intensified in a great degree when, beside the ballet-master
Muzarelli, a second ballet-master, Mr. Salvatore Vigano, whose wife
disclosed to the eyes of the spectators a thitherto unsuspected art, also
gave entertainments. The most important affairs of state are scarcely
able to create a greater war of feeling than was brought about at the
time by the rivalry of the two ballet-masters. Theatre-lovers without
exception divided themselves into two parties who looked upon each
other with hatred and contempt because of a difference of conviction....
The new ballet-master owed his extraordinary triumph over his
older rival to his restoration of his art back from the exaggerated, inexpressive
artificialities of the old Italian ballet to the simple forms of
nature. Of course, there was something startling in seeing a form of
drama with which thitherto there had been associated only leaps, contortions,
constrained positions, and complicated dances which left behind
them no feeling of unity, suddenly succeeded by dramatic action, depth
of feeling, and plastic beauty of representation as they were so magnificently
developed in the earlier ballets of Mr. Salvatore Vigano, opening,
as they did, a new realm of beauty. And though it may be true that it
was especially the natural, joyous, unconstrained dancing of Madame
Vigano and her play of features, as expressive as it was fascinating,
which provoked the applause of the many, it is nevertheless true that
the very subject-matter of the ballets, which differentiate themselves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
very favorably from his later conceits, and his then wholly classical,
skilful and manly dancing, were well calculated to inspire admiration
and respect for the master and his creations.</p></div>

<p>Two or three pages might be compiled of spicy matter upon
the beautiful Mme. Vigano’s lavish display of the Venus-like
graces and charms of her exquisite form; but her name, long before
the “Prometheus” ballet, had disappeared from the roll of the
theatre and Fräulein Cassentini reigned in her stead. There was
nothing derogatory to Beethoven in his acceptance of the commission
to compose the music to a ballet by Vigano; but by whom
commissioned, upon what terms, and when&mdash;concerning these and
similar particulars, we know nothing. We only know, that at
the close of the season before Easter, on the 28th of March,
“<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Die Geschöpfe des Prometheus</span>” was performed for the first
time for the benefit of the prima ballerina of the ballet corps,
Fräulein Cassentini, and that the whole number of its performances
this year was sixteen, and in 1802 thirteen. The pecuniary
result to Beethoven must therefore have been satisfactory. True,
the full score did not appear in print in Beethoven’s lifetime or
for a long time thereafter; it was not published, indeed, until
the appearance of the critical Complete Edition, in which it figures
as No. 11 of Series II; nothing is known of the original manuscript.
A copy revised except as to two numbers, is in the Royal Imperial
Court Library at Vienna. A pianoforte arrangement of the score
was published in June, 1801, by Artaria with the opus number
24 and a dedication to Prince Lichnowsky. Hoffmeister printed
the orchestral parts and a pianoforte score in 1804 as Op.&nbsp;43
(the number 24 having meanwhile been assigned to the Violin
Sonata in F). Mention ought, perhaps, also to be made of a pianoforte
arrangement of No. 8 for four hands “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">composé pour la famille
Kobler par Louis van Beethoven. Cette pièce se trouve aussi à gr.
Orchestre dans le même Magazin.</span>” The Kobler family was frequently
in Vienna, among other times in 1814; it had nothing
to do with the “Prometheus” music.</p>

<p>Alois Fuchs has preserved a characteristic anecdote which
came to him “from the worthy hand of a contemporary”:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>When Beethoven had composed the music to the ballet “Die
Geschöpfe des Prometheus” in 1801, he was one day met by his former
teacher, the great Joseph Haydn, who stopped him at once and said:
“Well, I heard your ballet yesterday and it pleased me very much!”
Beethoven replied: “O, dear Papa, you are very kind; but it is far from
being a ‘Creation!’” Haydn, surprised at the answer and almost offended,
said after a short pause: “That is true; it is not yet a ‘Creation’ and I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
can scarcely believe that it will ever become one.” Whereupon the men
said their adieus, both somewhat embarrassed.</p></div>

<p>From the period immediately following we have another
letter from Beethoven to Hoffmeister, dated April 22, 1801, in
which he says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Perhaps, too, it is the only sign of genius about me that my things
are not always in the best of order, and nobody can mend the matter
except myself. Thus, for instance, the pianoforte part, as is usual with
me, was not written out in score and I only now have made a fair copy of
it so that because of your haste you might not receive my too illegible
manuscript. So that the works may appear in the proper sequence as
far as possible I inform you that the following opus numbers ought to
be placed on the compositions:</p>

<p>The titles I will send you soon.</p>

<p>Set me down as a subscriber for the works of Johann Sebastian
Bach, also Prince Lichnowsky. The transcription of the Mozart sonata
(or sonatas) as quartets and quintets will do you honor and certainly
prove remunerative. In this also I should like to be of greater service,
but I am a disorderly individual and with the best of intentions I am
continually forgetting everything; yet I have spoken about the matter
here and there, and everywhere have found inclination towards it. It
would be a handsome thing if Mr. Brother besides doing this were to
publish an arrangement of the Septet for flute, as quintet, for example;
by this means the amateur flautists, who have already approached me
on the subject, would be helped and they would swarm around it like
hungry insects. To say something about myself, I have just written
a ballet in which the ballet-master did not do as well as he might have
done. Baron von Liechtenstein has endowed us with a product not
commensurate with the ideas which the newspapers have spread touching
his genius; another bit of evidence against the newspapers. The Baron
seems to have formed his ideal on Herr Müller in the marionette show,
without, however, having attained it.</p>

<p>These are the beautiful prospects under which we poor fellows in
Vienna are expected to flourish....</p></div>

<p>Under the same date Beethoven wrote to Breitkopf and
Härtel:</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Advice to the Critics of Leipsic</span></div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>... As regards your request for compositions by me I regret that at
this time I am unable to oblige you; but please tell me what kind of
compositions of mine you want, viz., symphonies, quartets, sonatas, etc.,
so that I may govern myself accordingly, and in case I have what you
need or want I may place it at your service. If I am right, 8 works of
mine are about to appear at Mollo’s in this place; four pieces at Hofmeister’s
in Leipsic; in this connection I wish to add that <i>one of my first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>

published by Hofmeister, and that Mollo is to publish a Concerto which,
indeed, was written later<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> <i>but nevertheless does not rank among the best of
my works in this form</i>. This is only a hint for your musical journal in
the matter of criticism of these works, although if one might hear them
(well-played, that is), one would best be able to judge them. Musical
policy requires that one should keep possession for a space of the best
concertos. You should recommend to Messrs. your critics great care
and wisdom especially in the case of the products of younger authors;
many a one may be frightened off who otherwise might, probably, accomplish
more; so far as I am concerned I am far from thinking that I am
so perfect as not to be subject to blame, yet the howls of your critics
against me were at first so humiliating that after comparing myself with
others I could not get angry, but remained perfectly quiet, and concluded
they did not understand their business; it was the easier to remain quiet
since I saw the praise lavished on people who have no significance in loco
in the eyes of the better sort, and who disappeared from sight here no
matter how good they may otherwise have been&mdash;but <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pax vobiscum</i>&mdash;peace
for me and them&mdash;I would not have mentioned a syllable about
the matter had not you yourself done so.</p>

<p>Coming recently to a friend who showed me the amount which
had been collected <i>for the daughter of the immortal god of harmony</i>, I marvel
at the smallness of the sum which Germany, especially <i>your Germany</i>,
had contributed in recognition of the individual who seems to me worthy
of respect for her father’s sake, which brings me to the thought how
would it do if I were to publish a work for the benefit of this person by
subscription, acquaint the public each year with the amount and its
proceeds in order to assure her against possible misfortune. Write me
quickly how this might best be accomplished so that something may be
done before <i>this Bach</i> dies, before this brook<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> dries up and we be no longer
able to supply it with water. That you would publish the work is self-evident.</p></div>

<p>Poor Maximilian’s health having become precarious, the
welfare of the Teutonic Order in those revolutionary times demanded
that a wise and energetic successor to him as Grand
Master should be secured in the person of an efficient coadjutor.
The thoughts of all parties concerned fixed upon a man who was
then not even a member of the order, in case he would join it and
accept the position, namely, the famous Archduke Karl. A Grand
Chapter was therefore called at Vienna, which opened June 1st,
and which unanimously admitted him to membership, he receiving
a dispensation from taking the oaths for the time being. On<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
June 3rd, he was elected coadjutor and on the 11th he received
the accolade. The circular which called the meeting brought to
the Austrian capital the whole body of officials employed at Mergentheim,
and thus it happened that Stephan von Breuning,
whose name appears in the Calendar of the order from 1797 to
1803, inclusive, as <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Hofrathsassessor</span>, came again to Vienna and
renewed intimate personal intercourse with Beethoven. Another
of our old Bonn acquaintances had also recently come thither,
he of whom (in the opinion of the present writer) Beethoven
writes to Amenda: “Now to my comfort a man has come again”&mdash;namely,
Anton Reicha. In the spring of this year Beethoven
removed from the Tiefer Graben into rooms overlooking one of
the bastions&mdash;there is little if any doubt, the Wasserkunstbastei&mdash;and
in one of those houses the main entrances to which are in
the Sailerstätte. At a later period of his life he came thither
again, and with good reason; for those houses not only afforded
a beautiful view over the Glacis and the Landsstrasse suburb,
but plenty of sun and fresh air. In the Hamberger house, where
now stands No. 15, he had often gone with his exercises to Joseph
Haydn, and hard by lived his friend Anton von Türkheim, Royal
Imperial <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Truchsess</span>&mdash;that is, carver.</p>

<p>This year he chose Hetzendorf for his summer retreat. Those
who know well the environs of Vienna, are aware that this village
offers less attraction to the lover of nature than a hundred others
within easy distance of the city. There is nothing to invite one,
who is fond of the solitude of the forest, but the thick groves in
the garden of Schönbrunn some ten minutes’ walk distant. It
is certainly possible that Beethoven’s state of health may have
forbidden him to indulge his taste for long rambles, and that the
cool shades of Schönbrunn, so easily and at all times accessible,
may have determined his choice. It would be pleasant to believe,
though there is no evidence to support such a belief, that some
feeling of regard for his former patron Maximilian, who had sought
retirement at Hetzendorf, was one of the causes which induced
the composer to spend this summer there.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Oratorio: “The Mount of Olives”</span></div>

<p>That was a period at Vienna fruitful in short sacred cantatas.
On certain days in the spring and late autumn no theatrical performances
were allowed and the principal composers embraced
the opportunity to exhibit their skill and invention in this branch
of their art; sometimes in concerts for their own benefit, more
commonly in those for public charities. Haydn, Salieri, Winter,
Süssmayr, Paër, are names that will occur in this connection to
every student of Vienna’s musical annals. Beethoven, ever ready to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
compete with the greatest talent in at least one work, and desirous
of producing at his next concert the novelty of an extensive vocal
composition by himself, determined to compose a work of this
class. The subject chosen was “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Christus am Ölberg</span>.”<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> Its
composition was the grand labor of this summer. “The text
was written by me in collaboration with the poet within 14 days,”
writes Beethoven in one of his letters, “but the poet was musical
and had already written many things for music; I was able to
consult with him at any moment.” This poet was Franz Xaver
Huber, fertile writer in general literature and a popular author
for the Vienna stage, who occupied so high a place in public
esteem, that his consent to prepare the text of the “Christus”
is another indication of the high reputation of Beethoven. The
merits and demerits of the poem need not be expatiated upon;
Beethoven’s own words show that he was in part responsible for
them. Schindler says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Beethoven also lived in Hetzendorf in 1805 and composed his
“Fidelio.” A coincidence touching the two works, one that remained
in the lively memory of Beethoven for many years, was that he composed
both of them in the thicket of the forest in the Schönbrunner Hofgarten,
sitting on the hill between two oaks which branched out from the trunk
about two feet from the ground. This oak, which always remained
remarkable in his eyes (it is to the left of the Gloriet), I found again
with Beethoven as late as 1823, and it awakened in him interesting
memories of the early period.</p></div>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>So far as has been determined, the compositions completed
in 1801 were the Sonatas for Pianoforte and Violin, Op.&nbsp;23 and 24;
the Pianoforte Sonatas in A-flat, Op.&nbsp;26, E-flat, Op.&nbsp;27, No. 1,
and C-sharp minor, Op.&nbsp;27, No. 2, and D major, Op.&nbsp;28; and
the Quintet in C major, Op.&nbsp;29. “The Andante in D minor of
the Sonata, Op.&nbsp;28,” says Czerny, “was long his favorite and he
played it often for his own pleasure.” The twelve Contradances
and six Rustic Dances (<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Ländler</i>) are sketched in part on the first
staves of the Kessler sketchbook. If we are justified in assuming
that they were composed for the balls of the succeeding winter
and were played from manuscript, it would follow that they also
are to be counted among the compositions completed in this year.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Publications of the Year 1801</span></div>

<p>The published works were the Concerto for Pianoforte and
Orchestra, Op.&nbsp;15, dedicated “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">À son Altesse Madame la Princesse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
Odescalchi née Keglevics</span>”; the Sonata for Pianoforte and
Horn, Op.&nbsp;17, dedicated “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">À Madame la Baronne de Braun</span>”; the
Quintet for Pianoforte, Oboe, Clarinet, Horn and Bassoon, Op.
16, dedicated “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">À son Altesse Monseigneur le Prince Régnant de
Schwarzenberg</span>.” These three works were announced by Mollo
and Co. on March 21. Furthermore, the music to “Prometheus,”
arranged for Pianoforte (according to Czerny by the composer)
and dedicated “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">A sua Altezza la Signora Principessa Lichnowsky,
nata Contessa Thun</span>,” published in June by Artaria as Op.&nbsp;27;
“<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">6 Variations très faciles</span>” on an original theme in G, announced
by Johann Traeg as absolutely new on August 11, sketched in
the preceding year but probably completed in this; the Sonatas,
Op.&nbsp;23 and 24, dedicated “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">À Monsieur le Comte Maurice de
Fries</span>,” announced on October 28; the six Quartets, Op.&nbsp;18, dedicated
“<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">À son Altesse Monseigneur le Prince Régnant de Lobkowitz</span>,”
announced (second series) on October 28 by Mollo. The
Pianoforte Concerto in B-flat, Op.&nbsp;19, dedicated “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">À Monsieur
Charles Nikl Noble de Nikelsberg</span>,” and the Symphony in C,
Op.&nbsp;21, dedicated “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">À son Excellence Monsieur le Baron van
Swieten</span>,” were published by Hoffmeister and Kühnel of Leipsic
certainly before the end of the year, since they reached Vienna
on January 16, and were advertised there. An earlier Leipsic
edition has not been found. The two Violin Sonatas in A minor
and F major were dedicated to Count Moritz von Fries and were
originally intended to be coupled in a single opus number (23),
as appears from the preliminary announcement by Mollo in the
“<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Wiener Zeitung</span>” of October 28, 1801, and also by the designation
of the second as “No. 2,” on a copy of Op 24. Sketches of
the two found in the Petters sketchbook are evidence of their
simultaneous origin.</p>

<p>The Pianoforte Sonata, Op.&nbsp;26, had its origin, according to
Nottebohm’s study of the sketches, in the year 1800; but Shedlock
(in the “Musical Times” of August, 1892) prints a few beginnings
of the first movement in B minor (!) which probably date
farther back, perhaps to the Bonn period. A young composer,<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a>
Ferdinand Paër (born at Parma in 1771), since the beginning of
1798 had produced on the court stage a series of pleasing and
popular works. Laboring in a sphere so totally different from
that of Beethoven, there was no rivalry between them and their
relations were cordial and friendly. On June 6th of this summer
Paër brought out a heroic opera, “Achilles,” which “was received<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
with a storm of approval and deserved it,” says the correspondent
of the “Zeitung für die Elegante Welt.” Paër in his old age
told Ferdinand Hiller a characteristic anecdote of Beethoven
which cannot possibly be true in connection with his “Leonore,”
as he, by a lapse of memory, related it, but is, undoubtedly, in
connection with “Achilles.” It was to the effect that Beethoven
went with Paër to the theatre where an opera by the latter was
performing. He sat beside him and after he had time and again
cried out, “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Ah, que c’est beau, que c’est intéressant!</span>” had finally
said: “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Il faut que je compose cela.</span>” The correspondent just
cited complains of the “want of character” in the marches in
“Achilles” and incidentally confirms one of Ries’s “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Notizen</span>”:
“The funeral march in A-flat minor in the Sonata dedicated to
Prince Lichnowsky (Op.&nbsp;26) was the result of the great praise
with which the funeral march in Paër’s ‘Achilles’ was received
by Beethoven’s friends.” Of that Sonata, completed this year,
Czerny says: “When Cramer was in Vienna and was creating a
great sensation not only by his playing but also by the three sonatas
which he dedicated to Haydn (of which the first in A-flat, &frac34; time,
awakened great amazement), Beethoven, who had been pitted
against Cramer, wrote the A-flat Sonata, Op.&nbsp;26, in which there
is purposely a reminder of the Clementi-Cramer passage-work in
the Finale. The <i>Marcia funebre</i> was composed on the impulsion
of a very much admired funeral march of Paër’s, and added to
the Sonata.”</p>

<p>Whether or not this funeral march was really occasioned by
Paër’s “Achilles” or one from another opera by Paër (since
“Achilles” was performed for the first time in 1801, and the older
first sketches already contemplated a “<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">pezzo caracteristico p. e.
una marcia in as moll</span>”), is of subordinate interest, since the legend
has nothing whatever to do with reminiscences, but only with its
tremendous superiority to the music by Paër.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The enigmatic “Sonata pour M.” in the sketches for this sonata
no doubt means “for Mollo” simply. The splendid print in <i>facsimile</i>,
published by Erich Praeger from the autograph discovered by him, gives
information concerning the sketches and also concerning the legends
which refer to the origin of the different movements.</p></div>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">The C-Sharp Minor Sonata</span></div>

<p>Of the two Pianoforte Sonatas, Op.&nbsp;27, the first (in E-flat)
was dedicated to the Princess Johanna von Liechtenstein, <i>née</i> the
Landgravine Fürstenberg, the second to Countess Giulietta Guicciardi.
It is apparent, therefore, that they appeared separately
at first. Sketches of the first show that they originated in 1801.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
Both are designated “quasi fantasia,” which plainly indicates
a departure from the customary structure. The C-sharp minor
Sonata, Op.&nbsp;27, No. 2, was dedicated to the Countess Giulietta
Guicciardi, who at this time (1801-1802) was Beethoven’s pupil
and indubitably must be counted amongst the ladies who, for a
time at least, were near to his heart. Concerning this, later.
As his relationship to the Countess has been exaggerated, so also
more significance has been attached to this sonata than is justified
from a sober point of view. Beethoven himself was vexed that
more importance was attached to it than to other sonatas
which he held in higher esteem (Op.&nbsp;78, for instance), simply because
it had become popular. Its popularity was subsequently heightened
by the designations “Arbor Sonata” and “Moonlight
Sonata” and its creation into a sort of love-song without words,
especially after Schindler had identified the Countess Guicciardi
with the “Immortal Beloved” of the famous love-letter. It was
a long time before attention was paid to a letter written by
Dr. G. L. Grosheim, to Beethoven, dated November 10, 1819, in
which occur the words: “You wrote me that at Seume’s grave (in
Teplitz) you had placed yourself among his admirers.... It is
a desire which I cannot suppress, that you, Mr. Chapelmaster,
would give to the world your wedding with Seume&mdash;I mean
your Fantasia in C-sharp minor and the ‘<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Beterin</span>’.”<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a></p>

<p>The autograph of the Sonata in D, Op.&nbsp;28, bears the inscription
“<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Gran Sonata, Op.&nbsp;28, 1801, da L. van Beethoven.</span>” It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
appeared in print in 1802, having been advertised in the “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Wiener
Zeitung</span>” of August 14, from the <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Industriekontor</span>, with the dedication,
“<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">À Monsieur Joseph Noble de Sonnenfels, Conseiller
aulique et Sécrétaire perpétuel de l’Académie des Beaux Arts</span>.”
Touching the personality of Joseph Noble de Sonnenfels something
may be learned from W. Nagel’s book, “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Beethoven und
seine Klaviersonaten</span>,” and also from Willibald Müller’s biography
of him. At the time, Sonnenfels was nearly 70 years old and, so
far as is known, was not an intimate friend of Beethoven’s; the
dedication was probably nothing more than a mark of respect
for the man of brains with whose ideas Beethoven was in sympathy.
The single clue as to the origin of the work is the date (1801) on
the autograph; sketches seem to be lacking. The sunny disposition
of the music is the only evidence, and this is internal. The
work early acquired the sobriquet “Sonata pastorale” (it was
first printed by A. Cranz), and the designation is not inept.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">The String Quintet in C, Op.&nbsp;29</span></div>

<p>The String Quintet, Op.&nbsp;29, as is evidenced by an inscription
on the score, was composed in 1801 and published by Breitkopf
and Härtel in 1802, towards the close of the year. Simultaneously
it appeared from the press of Artaria. This second edition has
a history. According to Ries the Quintet</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>was stolen in Vienna and published by A. (Artaria) and Co. Having
been copied in a single night, it was full of errors.... Beethoven’s
conduct in the matter is without parallel. He asked A. to send the
fifty copies which had been printed to me for correction, but at the same
time instructed me to use ink on the wretched paper and as coarsely
as possible; also to cross out several lines so that it would be impossible
to make use of a single copy or sell it. The scratching out was particularly
in the Scherzo. I obeyed his instructions implicitly, etc.</p></div>

<p>Nottebohm has proved that the further statements of Ries
touching the melting of the plates, etc., are wrong; but the enraged
composer did make a public statement&mdash;and very properly:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="center">
To the Lovers of Music.
</p>

<p>In informing the public that the original Quintet in C long ago
advertised by me as having been published by Breitkopf and Härtel
in Leipsic, I declare at the same time that I have no interest in the
edition published simultaneously by Messrs. Artaria and Mollo in Vienna.
I am the more compelled to make this declaration since this edition is
very faulty, incorrect and utterly useless to players, whereas Messrs.
Breitkopf and Härtel, the legal owners of this Quintet, have done all
in their power to produce the work as handsomely as possible.</p>

<p class="sig">
Ludwig van Beethoven.</p></div>

<p>A year later Beethoven revoked this declaration so far as it
concerned Mollo in the following</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="center">
Announcement to the Public.
</p>

<p>After having inserted a statement in the “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Wiener Zeitung</span>” of
January 22, 1803, in which I publicly declared that the edition of my
Quintet published by Mollo did not appear under my supervision, was
faulty in the extreme and useless to players, the undersigned hereby
revokes the statement to the extent of saying that Messrs. Mollo and Co.
have no interest in this edition, feeling that I owe such a declaration
to do justice to Messrs. Mollo and Co. before a public entitled to respect.</p>

<p class="sig">
Ludwig van Beethoven.
</p></div>

<p>As Nottebohm has shown, Beethoven eventually agreed to
revise and correct this edition also. A long letter to Breitkopf and
Härtel, dated November 13, 1802, gives a lively picture of the
excitement which the incident aroused in Beethoven:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I write hurriedly to inform you of only the most important things&mdash;know
then, that while I was in the country for my health, the arch-scoundrel
Artaria borrowed the Quintet from Count Friess on the
pretence that it was already published and in existence here and that
they wanted it for the purpose of reëngraving because their copy was
faulty and as a matter of fact intended to rejoice the public with it in a
few days&mdash;good Count Fr., deceived and not reflecting that a piece of
rascality might be in it, gave it to them&mdash;he could not ask me, I was
not here, but fortunately I learned of the matter in time, it was on Tuesday
of this week, and in my zeal to save my honor and as quickly as possible
to prevent your suffering injury, I offered two new works to these contemptible
persons if they would suppress the entire edition, but a cooler-headed
friend who was with me asked, Do you want to reward these rascals?
The case was finally closed under conditions, they assuring me that no
matter what you printed they would reprint it, these generous scoundrels
decided therefore to wait three weeks after the receipt here of your
copies before issuing their own (insisting that Count F. had made them
a present of the copy). For one term the contract was to be closed and
for this boon I had to give them a work which I value at at least 40
ducats. Before this contract was made comes my good brother as if

swindle in the world, how neatly they kept themselves out of Count F.’s
way and so on, and I go to F. and as the enclosed <i>Revers</i> may show that
I did all in my power to protect you from injury&mdash;and my statement
of the case may serve to prove to you that no sacrifice was too great for
me to save my honor and save you from harm. From the <i>Revers</i> you
will see the measures that must be adopted and you should make all
possible haste to send copies here and if possible at the same price as
the rascals&mdash;Sonnleithner and I will take all further measures which
seem to us good, so that their entire edition may be destroyed&mdash;please
take good notice that Mollo and Artaria combined are already only a
shop, that is, a combined lot of scoundrels. The dedication to Friess
I hope was not forgotten inasmuch as my brother wrote it on the first sheet&mdash;I
wrote the <i>Revers</i> myself since my poor brother is very much occupied
with work yet did all he could to save you and me, in the confusion he
lost a faithful dog which he called his favorite, he deserves that you
thank him personally as I have done on my own account&mdash;recall that
from Tuesday to late last night I devoted myself almost wholly to this
matter and the mere thought of this rascally stroke may serve to make
you realize how unpleasant it is for me to have anything to do with
such miserable men.</p>

<p>Under date of December 5, 1802, Beethoven’s brother Karl
wrote to Breitkopf and Härtel on the same subject:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Finally I shall inform you touching the manner in which my brother
sells his works. We already have in print 34 works and about 18 numbers.
These pieces were mostly commissioned by amateurs under the following
agreement: he who wants a piece pays a fixed sum for its exclusive
possession for a half or a whole year, or longer, and binds himself not
to give the manuscript to <i>anybody</i>; at the conclusion of the period it is
the privilege of the author to do what he pleases with the work. This
was the understanding with Count Friess. Now the Count has a certain
Conti as violin teacher, and to him Artaria turned and he probably for
a consideration of 8 or 10 florins said that the quartet (<i>sic</i>) had already
been printed and was to be had everywhere. This made Count Friess<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
think that there was nothing more to be lost in the matter and he gave
it up without a word to us about it.... Count Friess is not here
just now, but he will return in 6 days and then we shall see that you
are recompensed in one way or another. I send you the accompanying
<i>Revers</i> signed by Artaria for inspection; please return it. This <i>Revers</i>
cost my brother 7 days during which time he could do nothing, and me
innumerable trips, many unpleasantnesses and the loss of my dog.<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a></p></div>

<p>Beethoven’s declaration not having been published until more
than two months after his letter containing the <i>Revers</i>, the incidents
touching which Ries makes report, and the partial reëngraving
of the plates, must have taken place after January, 1803, and
the end of the quarrel in 1804. Sketches of the Quintet have
not been found and the question naturally arises whether or not
it might have had an earlier origin or been developed from earlier
sketches. A note in a Conversation Book of 1826, indicates that
one of the Quintet’s themes was written by Schuppanzigh.</p>

<p>Let us now turn back to the important letters written in the

Amenda, which were first published in the “Signale” of 1852,
No. 5. The first, without date or record of place, is as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>How can Amenda doubt that I shall always remember him<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> because

Your faithful<br />

Beethoven.</p></div>

<p>The longer letter which he had promised to send to his friend
is dated June 1, 1801:</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">The Composer’s Health in 1801</span></div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>My dear, good Amenda, my cordial friend, I received and read
your last letter with mixed pain and pleasure. To what shall I compare
your fidelity, your attachment to me. Oh, it is so beautiful that you
have always been true to me and I know how to single you out and
keep you above all others. You are not a Viennese friend, no, you
are one of those who spring from the ground of my native land. How
often do I wish you were with me, for your Beethoven is living an unhappy
life, quarreling with nature and its creator, often cursing the latter
because he surrendered his creatures to the merest accident which sometimes
broke or destroyed the most beautiful blossoms. Know that my
noblest faculty, my hearing, has greatly deteriorated. When you were
still with me I felt the symptoms but kept silent; now it is continually
growing worse, and whether or not a cure is possible has become a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
question; but it is said to be due to my bowels and so far as they are concerned
I am nearly restored to health. I hope, indeed that my hearing
will also improve, but I am dubious because such diseases are the most
incurable. How sad is my lot! I must avoid all things that are dear
to me and live amongst such miserable and egotistical men as ...
and ... and others. I must say that amongst them all Lichnowsky is the
most satisfactory, since last year he has settled an income of 600 florins on
me and the good sale of my works enables me to live without care. I
could sell everything that I compose five times over and at a good price.
I have written considerably of late, and as I hear that you have ordered
a pianoforte from ... I will send you various things in the box of
the instrument so that it need not cost you much. To my comfort
there has lately come a man with whom I can share the pleasures of
association, an unselfish friendship; he is one of the friends of my youth.
I have often spoken of you to him and told him that since I left my
fatherland you have been the only choice of my heart. ... is not very
satisfactory to him&mdash;he is and always will be too weak for friendship.
I use him and ... only as instruments on which I play when I
please but they can never become witnesses of my whole internal and
external activities or real participants (in my feelings). I estimate
them at only what they are worth to me. Oh, how happy would I be
if my hearing were completely restored; then would I hurry to you,
but as it is I must refrain from everything and the most beautiful years
of my life must pass without accomplishing the promise of my talent
and powers. A sad resignation to which I must resort although, indeed,
I am resolved to rise superior to every obstacle. But how will that be
possible? Yes, Amenda, if my infirmity shows itself to be incurable
in half a year, I shall appeal to you; you must abandon everything and
come to me. My affliction causes me the least trouble in playing and
composing, the most in association with others, and you must be my
companion. I am sure my fortune will not desert me. What might I
not essay? Since you have been gone I have composed everything except
operas and church-music. You will not deny me; you will help your
friend bear his cares and affliction. I have also greatly bettered my
pianoforte playing and I hope the journey will, perhaps, make your
fortune; afterward you will remain with me. I have received all of
your letters and despite the fact that I answered so few you were always
with me and my heart still beats as tenderly for you as ever it did. I
beg of you to keep the matter of my deafness a profound secret to <i>be
confided to nobody no matter who it is</i>. Write to me very often. Your
letters, no matter how short, comfort me, do me good, and I shall soon
expect another from you, my dear fellow. Do not lend your quartet
to anybody because I have changed it greatly having just learned how
properly to write quartets, as you will observe when you receive it.
Now, farewell, my dear, good fellow; if you think I can do something
for you here, command me as a matter of course.</p>

<p class="sig">
Your faithful, and truly affectionate<br />
L. v. Beethoven.
</p></div>

<p>In the same month Beethoven wrote again to the publisher
Hoffmeister to this effect:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I am a little amazed at what you have communicated to me through
the local representative of your business. I am almost vexed to think
that you consider me capable of such a trick.</p>

<p>It would be a different matter if I had sold my wares only to avaricious
tradesmen hoping that they would make a good speculation on
the sly, but <i>as artist towards artist</i> it is a bit harsh to think such things
of me. It looks to me as if the whole matter had been planned to test
me or to be merely a suspicion; in either case I inform you that before
you received the Septet from me I sent it to London to Mr. Salomon
(for performance at his concerts out of mere friendship) but with the
understanding that he should have a care that it should not fall into the
hands of strangers, because I intended that it should be published in
Germany, concerning which, if you think it necessary, you may make
inquiry of him. But in order to prove my honesty <i>I give you the assurance
herewith that I have not sold the Septet, Concerto, the Symphony and
the Sonata to anybody but you, Hoffmeister and Kühnel, and that you may
consider it (sic) as your exclusive property and to this I pledge my honor</i>.
You may make such use of this assurance as you please.</p>

<p>As for the rest I believe as little that Salomon is capable of being
guilty of having the Septet printed as I am of having sold it to him. I
am so conscientious that I have denied the applications of <i>various publishers</i>
to print the pianoforte arrangement of the Septet, and yet I
do not know whether or not you intend to make such use of it.</p></div>

<p>On June 29, he sent the following longer letter to Wegeler,
who published it in his “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Notizen</span>”:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="dateline">
Vienna, June 29.</p>

<p class="salut">My good, dear Wegeler!
</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Greetings to Old Friends in Bonn</span></div>

<p>How greatly do I thank you for thinking of me; I have so
little deserved it and so little tried to deserve anything from you, and
yet you are so very good and refuse to be held aloof by anything,
not even by my unpardonable remissness, remaining always my true,
good, brave friend. Do not believe that I could forget you who were
always so dear to me. No. There are moments when I long for you
and would like to be with you. My fatherland, the beautiful region in
which I first saw the light, is still as clear and beautiful before my eyes
as when I left you. In short, I shall look upon that period as one of the
happiest incidents of my life when I shall see you again and greet Father
Rhine. When this shall be I cannot now tell you&mdash;but I want to say
that you will see me again only as a great man. Yon shall receive me as
a great artist but as a better and more perfect man, and if the conditions
are improved in our fatherland my art shall be employed in the service
of the poor. O happy moment! How happy am I that I created thee&mdash;can
invoke thee!... You want to know something about my situation.
It is not so bad. Since last year, unbelievable as it may sound, even
after I tell you, Lichnowsky, who has always remained my warmest
friend (there were little quarrels between us, but they only served to
strengthen our friendship), set aside a fixed sum of 600 florins for me to
draw against so long as I remained without a position worthy of me.
From my compositions I have a large income and I may say that I have
more commissions than it is possible for me to fill. Besides, I have 6<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
or 7 publishers and might have more if I chose; they no longer bargain
with me&mdash;I ask, and they pay. You see it is very convenient. For instance,
I see a friend in need and my purse does not permit me to help him at once.
I have only to sit down and in a short time help is at hand. Moreover, I am
a better business man than formerly. If I remain here always I shall bring
it to pass that I shall always reserve a day for my concert of which I give
several. The only pity is that my evil demon, my bad health, is continually
putting a spoke in my wheel, by which I mean that my hearing
has grown steadily worse for three years for which my bowels, which
you know were always wretched and have been getting worse, since I
am always troubled with a dysentery, in addition to unusual weakness,
are said to be responsible. Frank wanted to tone up my body by tonic
medicines and restore my hearing with almond oil, but, <i>prosit</i>, nothing
came of the effort; my hearing grew worse and worse, and my bowels
remained as they had been. This lasted until the autumn of last year
and I was often in despair. Then came a medical ass who advised me
to take cold baths, a more sensible one to take the usual lukewarm
Danube bath. That worked wonders; my bowels improved, my hearing
remained, or became worse. I was really miserable during this winter;
I had frightful attacks of colic and I fell back into my previous condition,
and so things remained until about four weeks ago, when I went to Vering,
thinking that my condition demanded a surgeon, and having great
confidence in him. He succeeded almost wholly in stopping the
awful diarrhœa. He prescribed the lukewarm Danube bath, into
which I had each time to pour a little bottle of strengthening stuff,
gave me no medicine of any kind until about four weeks ago, when
he prescribed pills for my stomach and a kind of tea for my ear. Since
then I can say I am stronger and better; only my ears whistle and buzz
continually, day and night. I can say I am living a wretched life; for
two years I have avoided almost all social gatherings because it is impossible
for me to say to people: “I am deaf.” If I belonged to any other
profession it would be easier, but in my profession it is an awful state,
the more since my enemies, who are not few, what would they say?
In order to give you an idea of this singular deafness of mine I must
tell you that in the theatre I must get very close to the orchestra in
order to understand the actor. If I am a little distant I do not hear
the high tones of the instruments, singers, and if I be but a little farther
away I do not hear at all. Frequently I can hear the tones of a low
conversation, but not the words, and as soon as anybody shouts it is intolerable.
It seems singular that in conversation there are people who do
not notice my condition at all, attributing it to my absent-mindedness.<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a>
Heaven knows what will happen to me. <i>Vering says that there will be
an improvement if no complete cure.</i> I have often&mdash;cursed my existence;
<i>Plutarch</i> taught me resignation. If possible I will bid defiance
to my fate, although there will be moments in my life when I shall be
the unhappiest of God’s creatures. I beg of you to say nothing of my
condition to anybody, not even to Lorchen;<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> I entrust the secret only
to you; I would be glad if you were to correspond with Vering on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
subject. If my condition continues I will go to you next spring; you
could hire a house for me in some pretty place in the country and for
half a year I would be a farmer. This might bring about a change.
Resignation! What a wretched refuge&mdash;and yet the only one open to
me. Forgive me that I add these cares of friendship to yours which is
sorrowful enough as it is. Steffen Breuning is here now and we are
together almost daily; it does me so much good to revive the old emotions.
He is really become a good, splendid youngster, who knows a
thing or two, and like us all has his heart in the right place. I have a
pretty domicile on the bastion which is doubly valuable because of my
health. I believe I shall make it possible for Breuning to come to me.
You shall have your Antioch<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> and also many musical compositions of
mine if you do not think they will cost you too much. Honestly, your
love for art still delights me much. Write to me how it is to be done
and I will send you all my compositions, already a goodly number and
increasing daily.... In return for the portrait of my grandfather which
I beg of you to send me as soon as possible by mail-coach, I am sending
you that of his grandson, your good and affectionate Beethoven, which
is to be published here by Artaria, who, like many others, including
art-dealers, have often asked me for it. I shall soon write to Stoffel<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a>
and give him a piece of my mind concerning his stubborn disposition.
I will make his ears ring with the old friendship, and he shall promise
me by all that is holy not to offend you further in your present state
of unhappiness. I shall also write to good Lorche. I have never forgotten
one of you good people even if I did not write to you; but you know that
writing was never my forte; the best of my friends have not had a letter
from me in years. I live only in my notes and when one composition
is scarcely ended another is already begun. As I compose at present
I frequently work on three or four compositions at the same time. Write
to me often, hereafter. I will try occasionally to find time to write to
you. Give greetings to all, including the good Madame Councillor,<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a>
and tell her that I still occasionally have a “raptus.” As regards K.
I do not at all wonder over his change. Fortune is round, like a ball,
and therefore does not always drop on the noblest and best. A word
about Ries, whom I greet heartily; so far as his son is concerned I shall
write you more in detail, although I think that he would be more fortunate
in Paris than in Vienna. Vienna is overcrowded and the most meritorious
find it extremely difficult to maintain themselves. In the autumn or
winter I shall see what I can do for him, for at that time the public hurries
back to the city. Farewell, good, faithful Wegeler! Be assured of the
love and friendship of</p>

<p class="sig">
Your<br />

<p>On November 16, he wrote in greater detail to Wegeler:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="salut">
My good Wegeler!
</p>

<p>I thank you for the new evidence of concern in my behalf,
all the more since I deserve so little at your hands. You want to know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
how it goes with me, what I need; as little as I like to discuss such matters
I would rather do it with you than with others.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Deafness and a Romantic Attachment</span></div>

<p>For several months Vering has had vesicatories placed on both
arms, which consist, as you know, of a certain bark.<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> This is a very unpleasant
remedy, inasmuch as I am robbed of the free use of my arms
(for a few days, until the bark has had its effect), to say nothing of the
pain. It is true I cannot deny that the ringing and sounding in my
ears has become less than usual, especially in the left ear, where my
deafness began; but my hearing has not been improved and I dare not
say that it has not grown worse rather than better. My bowels are in
a better condition, especially after the lukewarm baths for a few days
when I feel quite well for 8 or 10 days, seldom needing a tonic for my
stomach. I am beginning to use the herbs on the belly as suggested
by you. Vering will hear nothing of plunge baths, and I am thoroughly
dissatisfied with him; he has much too little care and consideration for
such a disease; if I did not go to him, which costs me a great deal of
trouble, I should not see him at all. What do you think of Schmidt?
I do not like to change, but it seems to me Vering is too much of a practitioner
to acquire new ideas. Schmidt seems to me a very different sort
of man and, perhaps, would not be so negligent. Miracles are told of
<i>galvanism</i>; what have you to say about it? A doctor told me that he
had seen a deaf and dumb child recover his hearing (in Berlin) again&mdash;and
a man who had been deaf 7 years got well. I am living more pleasantly
since I live more amongst men. You will scarcely believe how
lonely and sad my life was for two years; my bad hearing haunted me
everywhere like a ghost and I fled from mankind and seemed like a
misanthrope, though far from being one. This change has been wrought
by a <i>dear, fascinating</i> girl who loves me and whom I love. There have
been a few blessed moments within the last two years and it is the first
time that I feel that marriage might bring me happiness. Alas! she is
not of my station&mdash;and now&mdash;it would be impossible for me to marry.
I must still hustle about most actively. If it were not for my deafness,
I should before now have travelled over half the world, and that I must do.
There is no greater delight for me than to practise and show my art.
Do not believe that I would be happy with you. What is there that
could make me happier? Even your care would give me pain. I
would see pity on your faces every minute and be only the unhappier.
What did those beautiful native regions bestow upon me? Nothing
except the hope of a better state of health, which would have come
had not this affliction seized upon me. Oh, if I were rid of this
affliction I could embrace the world! I feel that my youth is just beginning
and have I not always been ill? My physical strength has for a
short time past been steadily growing more than ever and also my mental
powers. Day by day I am approaching the goal which I apprehend
but cannot describe. It is only in this that your Beethoven can live.
Tell me nothing of rest. I know of none but sleep, and woe is me that
I must give up more time to it than usual. Grant me but half freedom
from my affliction and then&mdash;as a complete, ripe man I shall return to
you and renew the old feelings of friendship. You must see me as happy
as it is possible to be here below&mdash;not unhappy. No! I cannot endure it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
I will take Fate by the throat; it shall not wholly overcome me. Oh,
it is so beautiful to live&mdash;to live a thousand times! I feel that I am not
made for a quiet life. You will write to me as soon as you can. See
that Steffen secures an appointment of some kind in the <i>Teutonic Order</i>.
Life here is connected with too many hardships for his health. Besides,
he lives so isolated an existence that I cannot see how he is to get along
in this manner. You know the state of affairs here. I will not say that
social life may not lessen his moodiness; but it is impossible to persuade
him to go anywhere. A short time ago I had a <i>musicale</i> at my home;
yet our friend Steffen did not come. Advise him to seek more rest
and composure. I have done my best in this direction; without these
he will never be again happy or well. Tell me in your next letter whether
or not it will matter if I send you a great deal of my music; you can sell
what you do not need and so get back the post-money&mdash;and my portrait.
All possible lovely and necessary greetings to Lorchen, Mama and
Christoph. You love me a little, do you not? Be assured of the love
and friendship of</p>

<p>A commentary upon these letters&mdash;the first two excepted,
which need none&mdash;might be made, by a moderate indulgence of
poetic fancy, to fill a volume of respectable size; but rigidly confined
to prosaic fact may be reduced to reasonable dimensions.
Taking up the letters in their order, the first is that to Hoffmeister
of April 22nd.</p>

<p>I. One of the earliest projects of the new firm of Hoffmeister
and Kühnel was the publication of “J. Sebastian Bach’s Theoretical
and Practical Clavier and Organ Works.” The first number contained:
1, Toccata in D-flat; 2, fifteen inventions; 3, “The Well-Tempered
Clavichord”&mdash;in part; the second number: 1, 15 symphonies
in three voices; 2, continuation of “The Well-Tempered
Clavichord.” Now compare what Schindler says (third edition,
II, 184):</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Of the archfather Johann Sebastian Bach the stock was a very
small one except for a few motets which had been sung at the house of
van Swieten; besides these the majority of pieces were those familiarly
known, namely, the “Well-Tempered Clavichord,” which showed signs
of diligent study, three volumes of exercises, fifteen inventions, fifteen
symphonies and a toccata in D minor. This collection of pieces in <i>a
single volume</i> is to be found in my possession. Attached to these was a
sheet of paper on which, in a strange handwriting, was to be read the
following passage from J. N. Forkel’s book “On the Life and Artwork
of Johann Sebastian Bach”: “The pretence that the musical art is an art
for <i>all</i> ears cannot be substantiated by Bach, but is disproved by the mere
existence and uniqueness of his works, which seem to be destined only
for connoisseurs. Only the connoisseur who can surmise the inner organization
and feel it and penetrate to the intention of the artist, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
does nothing needlessly, is privileged to judge here; indeed, the judgment
of a musical connoisseur can scarcely be better tested than by seeing
how rightly he has learned the works of Bach.” On both sides of this
passage there were interrogation points from the thickest note-pen of
Beethoven as a gloss on the learned historian and most eminent of all
Bachians. No Hogarth could have put a grimmer look, or a more
crushing expression, into an interrogation point.</p></div>

<p>Nägele, who professed long to have entertained the design
to publish Bach’s “most admirable works,” issued his proposals
in February, written with some degree of asperity against “the
double competition” which, he had already learned, “was confronting”
him. Of his edition of “The Well-Tempered Clavichord”
Beethoven also possessed a part.</p>

<p>The names left blank in publishing this letter are easily supplied.
Baron Carl August von Liechtenstein, the same to whom,
from 1825 to 1832, was confided the management of the opera in
Berlin, who died there in 1845, had been so extravagantly praised
as head of the Princely Music at Dessau that he was called to
assume the chapelmastership of the Imperial Opera in Vienna
near the end of 1800. The contemporary reports of his efficiency
as conductor are highly favorable. He deserves the credit of
determining to add to the repertory of the Imperial Opera Mozart’s
“<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Zauberflöte</span>” which, till then, had been heard by the Viennese
only in the little theatre Auf-den-Wieden. It is worth mentioning
that Liechtenstein brought with him from Dessau poor Neefe’s
daughter Felice, now Mme. Rösner, and that she was the <i>Pamina</i>
of this performance. In the first new work produced (April 16th)
upon the imperial stage after Beethoven’s “Prometheus” music,
Liechtenstein introduced himself to the Vienna public in the character
of a composer. It was in his opera “Bathmendi,” completely
revised. The result was a wretched failure. Hoffmeister’s long
and familiar acquaintance with Vienna, its musicians and its
theatres, would cause him readily to appreciate the fun and wit
of Beethoven’s remark that the newly engaged chapelmaster and
composer of the Imperial Opera “seems to have taken for an ideal
Mr. M. (Müller)”&mdash;the Offenbach of that time&mdash;but without reaching
“even him.” Considering that the Baron was yet a young
man, at the most but three years older than Beethoven, the somewhat
bitter remark which follows the jest appears natural enough.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">The Composer and His Early Critics</span></div>

<p>II. Beethoven had just cause for indignation in the treatment
which he had received at the hands of the writers for the “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Allgemeine
Musikalische Zeitung</span>” (the “Leipsic oxen” of his letter of
January 15th). Hoffmeister had evidently written him on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
subject, and his reticence in confining himself in reply to a single
contemptuous sentence, though writing in the confidence of private
correspondence, is something unexpected; not less so is the manly,
dignified and ingenuous style of his answer to Breitkopf and
Härtel upon the same topic in the letter of April 22nd. The
first number of that famous musical journal (take it for all in all,
the noblest ever published) appeared October 3rd, 1798, edited by
Rochlitz, published by Breitkopf and Härtel. In the second number,
“Z...” eulogizes the Six Fughettos of the lad, C. M. von
Weber; in the tenth young Hummel’s sonatas, Op.&nbsp;3, are reviewed;
in the fifteenth the name of Beethoven first appears, viz.: in the
title of three sonatas dedicated to him by Wölffl. At length,
in No. 23, March 17th, 1799, he is introduced to the readers of
the journal as an author&mdash;not of one or more of the eight Trios,
ten Sonatas, the Quintet and Serenade, which make up the <i>opera</i>
1 to 11 then published&mdash;but as the writer of the Twelve Variations
on “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Ein Mädchen oder Weibchen</span>,” and eight on “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Une fièvre
brûlante</span>.”</p>

<p>The criticisms are a perfect reflex of the conventional musical
thought of the period and can be read now with amused interest,
at least. There is no room here for their production in full. The
writer, “M...,” recognizes the clever pianoforte player in the
Variations but cannot see evidences in them of equal capacity
as a composer. He likes some of them and “willingly admits”
that those on “Une fièvre brûlante” are “more successful than
those of Mozart, who in his early youth also treated the same subject.”
But Mozart did not write the variations referred to, and
when Grétry’s “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Richard Cœur de Lion</span>,” from which the theme
was borrowed, was first performed in Paris, Mozart was not in
his “early youth” but 28 years old. The critic descants with disapproval
on “certain harshnesses in the modulations,” illustrating
them; holds up Haydn as a model chooser of themes, and commends
the comments of Vogler on a set of variations on “God
save the King” printed in a little book on the subject. Thus
Beethoven found, in the first recognition of himself as a composer
in that journal, two compositions which he did not think worthy
of opus numbers, to the neglect of all his better works, made the
subject of censure and ridicule for the purpose of putting and advertising
a pamphlet by Vogler. Were his own subsequent Variations
on “God save the King” an effect of this article?</p>

<p>No. 23 of the “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Allgemeine Musikalische Zeitung</span>” contains
nearly two pages from the pen of Spazier on Liechtenstein’s opera,
“<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Die steinerne Braut</span>,” and a parallel between Beethoven and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
Wölffl as pianists. Then in the next number the beautiful Trio,
Op.&nbsp;6, finds a reviewer. Here is the whole of his article:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>This Trio, which in part is not easier but more flowing than many
other pieces by the same author, makes an excellent ensemble on the
pianoforte with accompaniment. The composer with his unusual harmonic
knowledge and love for serious composition would provide us
many things which would leave many hand-organ things far in the rear,
even those composed by famous men, if he would but try to write more
naturally.</p></div>

<p>Could one say less?</p>

<p>The “Leipsic oxen” are now ruminating upon the noble
Sonatas for Pianoforte and Violin, Op.&nbsp;12, and No. 36 (June, 1799),
contains the result:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The critic, who heretofore has been unfamiliar with the pianoforte
pieces of the author, must admit, after having looked through these
strange sonatas, overladen with difficulties, that after diligent and strenuous
labor he felt like a man who had hoped to make a promenade with
a genial friend through a tempting forest and found himself barred every
minute by inimical barriers, returning at last exhausted and without
having had any pleasure. It is undeniable that Mr. Beethoven
goes his own gait; but what a bizarre and singular gait it is! Learned,
learned and always learned&mdash;and nothing natural, no song. Yes, to be
accurate, there is <i>only a mass of learning here, without good method</i>;
obstinacy, but for which we feel but little interest; a striving for strange
modulations, an objection to customary associations, a heaping up of
difficulties on difficulties till one loses all patience and enjoyment. Another
critic (M. Z., No. 24) has said almost the same thing, and the present writer
must agree with him completely.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the present work must not be rejected wholly. It has
its value and may be of excellent use for already practised pianoforte
players. There are always many who love difficulties in invention and
composition, what we might call perversities, and if they play these
Sonatas with great precision they may derive delight in the music as
well as an agreeable feeling of satisfaction. If Mr. v. B. wished to deny
himself a bit more and follow the course of nature he might, with his
talent and industry, do a great deal for an instrument which he seems to
have so wonderfully under his control.</p></div>

<p>Let us pass on to No. 38 of the journal, where we find half a
dozen notices to arrest our attention. Variations by Schuppanzigh
for two violins are “written in good taste and conveniently for
the instrument”; variations for the pianoforte by Philip Freund
are very satisfactory and “some among them belong to the best of
their kind”; variations by Heinrich Eppinger for violin and violoncello
“deserve honorable mention”; but “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">X Variations pour le
clavecin sur le Duo ‘La stessa, la stessissima’ par L. v. Beethoven</span>”
the critic “cannot at all be satisfied with, because they are stiff<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
and strained; and what awkward passages are in them, where harsh
tirades in continuous semitones create an ugly relationship and
the reverse! No; it is true; Mr. van Beethoven may be able to
improvise, but he does not know how to write variations.”</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Change in the Tone of Criticism</span></div>

<p>Now, however, the tide begins to turn. After an interval
of nearly four months, in No. 2 of Vol. II (October, 1799), the
Sonatas, Op.&nbsp;12, for Pianoforte and Violin have a page allotted to
them. A few sentences to show the tone of the article will suffice;
for the praise of Beethoven needs no repetition:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>It is not to be denied that Mr. v. B. is a man of genius, possessed
of originality and who goes his own way. In this he is assured by his
extraordinary thoroughness in the higher style of writing and his unusual
command of the instrument for which he writes, he being unquestionably
one of the best pianoforte composers and players of our time. His
abundance of ideas, of which a striving genius never seems to be able to
let go so soon as it has got possession of a subject worthy of his fancy,
only too frequently leads him to pile up ideas, etc. Fancy, in the extraordinary
degree which Beethoven possesses, supported, too, by extraordinary
knowledge, is a valuable possession, and, indeed, an indispensable
one for a composer, etc. The critic, who, after he has tried to
accustom himself more and more to Mr. Beethoven’s manner, has learned
to admire him more than he did at first, can scarcely suppress the wish
that ... it might occur to this fanciful composer to practise a certain
economy in his labors.... This tenth collection, as the critic has
said, seems deserving of high praise. Good invention, an earnest, manly
style, ... well-ordered thoughts in every part, difficulties not carried
to an excess, an entertaining treatment of the harmony&mdash;lift these Sonatas
above the many.</p></div>

<p>In No. 21 (February, 1800) justice is done to the “Sonate
pathétique.” Except a passing notice of the publication of the
Quartets, Op.&nbsp;18, made by a correspondent, Vol. III of the “Allg.
Mus. Zeitung” contains <i>nothing</i> on the works of Beethoven. So
that more than a year passed between the favorable review of
the “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Sonate pathétique</span>” and the letter to Breitkopf and Härtel
of April 22nd. The mild tone of that missive is, therefore, easily
explained. The tone of the journal had completely changed; this
fact, and time, had assuaged Beethoven’s wrath, and finally the
publishers in applying to him for manuscripts had made the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">amende
honorable</i>.</p>

<p>In the number of May 26th begins, with a notice of the two
Sonatas for Pianoforte and Violin, Op.&nbsp;23 and Op.&nbsp;24, that long
series of fair, candid and generously eulogistic articles on Beethoven’s
works which culminated in July, 1810, in the magnificent
review of the C minor Symphony by E. T. A. Hoffmann&mdash;a labor of
love that laid the foundation of a new school of musical criticism.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span></p>

<p>III. Upon the last topic of the letter to Breitkopf and Härtel
something remains to be said. It was in the “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Intelligenzblatt</span>”
of the “Allg. Mus. Zeit.” for May, 1800, that Rochlitz made a
touching appeal for aid for the last survivor of Sebastian Bach’s
children. “This family,” says he, “has now died out down to
the single daughter of the great Sebastian Bach, and this daughter
is now very old.... This daughter is starving.... The
publishers of the ‘Musik Zeitung’ and I offer to obligate if anybody
shall entrust us with money to forward it in the most expeditious
and careful manner, and to give account of it in the ‘<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Intelligenzblätter</span>’.”
The first account is in the paper for December.
Regina Susanna Bach publishes her “thanks” for 96 thalers and
5 silbergroschens contributed, as the “careful account” which is
appended shows, by sixteen persons, four of whom, in Vienna,
sent more than 80 florins, leaving certainly but a small sum as
the offering of “her Germany.” One other&mdash;and only one&mdash;account
appears, in June, 1801. It is an acknowledgment by
Rochlitz, Breitkopf and Härtel and Fräulein Bach of having
received on May 10th the considerable sum of 307 florins Viennese
(the equal of 200 thalers)</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>through the Viennese musician Andreas Streicher, collected by Streicher
and Count Fries. At the same time the famous Viennese composer Herr
van Beethoven declares that he will publish one of his newest works
solely for the benefit of the daughter of Bach ... so that the good old
lady may derive the benefit of it from time to time. Therefore he
nobly urges that the publication be hastened as much as possible lest
the daughter of Bach die before his object be attained.</p></div>

<p>Whether or not any such work was published is not known.
Unsupported conjectures as to the names left blank in the letter
to Amenda when originally printed in the “Signale” are of no
use, and if made might hereafter expose the conjecturer to just
ridicule; there remain, then, but two topics which require a word
of comment&mdash;the year omitted in the date, and the friend of his
youth of whom Beethoven speaks in such strong terms of affection&mdash;both
of which, however, may better be disposed of, in
what is to be said upon the letter to Wegeler of June 29th.</p>

<p>This long, important and very interesting paper affords an
illustration of the readiness with which a conjecture may be accepted
as a truth, until one is compelled to subject it to rigid
examination. Thus, in using this letter for a particular purpose,<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a>
Wegeler’s date “most probably 1800” was accepted, as it had
universally been for forty years, without question; but the moment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
it became necessary to subject its entire contents to careful
scrutiny, for the purposes of this biography, the error became at
once so apparent as really to awaken a feeling of mortification
for the temporary blindness that allowed it to pass unquestioned.
The allusions to Susanna Bach (“You see it is very convenient,
etc.”), to his change of lodgings, to the publication of his portrait
by Artaria, and (in the second letter) to the change of his physicians,
are all more or less indicative of the true date, 1801, while the
mention of Breuning’s return to Vienna is proof positive. Finally,
the similarity, almost identity, of passages in the Amenda letter
to portions of this, shows that the two belong to the same June.
Thus we at last have the gratification of seeing these two valuable
documents fall easily and naturally into their true place in Beethoven’s
history. It is worth noting that this Wegeler letter offers&mdash;at
the least, appears to offer&mdash;an example of Beethoven’s occasional
loose way of making statements; as in the letter to Breitkopf
and Härtel he writes as if he had half a dozen unpublished
concertos on hand, so now he speaks of having “already given
several” <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Akademien</i>; and yet the most careful research has failed
to show that his concerts were at this time more than three in
number in all; or that he had ever even given more than one
public concert in Vienna. Perhaps, however, he may have included
those given in Prague in his “several.” As nothing can be added
to his account of his bad health and incipient deafness, we pass to
the passages upon Breuning and Ries.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Arrival in Vienna of Anton Reicha</span></div>

<p>IV. The opinion was before expressed, that the “man” spoken
of in the Amenda letter as having come to Vienna, to Beethoven’s
comfort, was Anton Reicha.<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> They were alike in age&mdash;Reicha
being but a few months the elder&mdash;and alike in tastes and pursuits.
Reicha was superior in the culture of schools and in what
is called musical learning; Beethoven in genius and originality
as a composer and in skill as a pianist. The talents of each
commanded the respect of the other. Both were aspiring, ambitious,
yet diverged sufficiently in their views of art to prevent
all invidious rivalry. Reicha gained a reputation which, in
process of time, secured him the high position which he held during
the last twenty years of his life&mdash;that of Méhul’s successor in
the Paris Conservatoire.</p>

<p>To Beethoven, who was still digesting plans for musical tours,
the experience of his friend must have been of great value; not
less to Reicha the experience of Beethoven in Vienna. But he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
was by no means dependent upon Beethoven for an introduction
into the highest musical circles of the capital. It has been shown
in a previous chapter how freely the salons were opened to every
talented young musician, but beyond this he bore a well-known
name and the veteran Haydn kindly remembered him as one of
the promising young men who had paid him their respects in
Bonn. His opera “Ubaldi” was performed in Prince Lobkowitz’s
palace, and this probably led to his introduction to the Empress
Maria Theresia, who gave him an Italian libretto, “<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Argene Regina
di Granata</span>,” for composition, in which the Empress herself sang
a part at the private performance in the palace.</p>

<p>Thus Beethoven and Reicha again met and lived on equal
terms. “We spent fourteen years together,”<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> said the latter, “as
closely united as Orestes and Pylades, and were always together
in our youth. After an eight years’ separation we met each other
again in Vienna and confided all our experiences to each other.”</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Beethoven and Stephan von Breuning</span></div>

<p>V. When Wegeler says of Stephan von Breuning, “But he
had, with short interruptions, spent his life in closest association
with Beethoven from his tenth year to his death,” he says too
much; and too little when he writes that Beethoven “had once
broken for a considerable space with Breuning (and with what
friend did he not?)” For besides the quarrel, which Ries describes,
there came at last so decided a separation that Breuning’s name
disappears from our history for a period of eight to ten years&mdash;and
that, too, not from <i>his</i> fault.</p>

<p>It was impossible that the two should have met in 1801 on
such terms as those on which they had parted in 1796. Breuning
had passed this interval of five years in a small provincial town,
Mergentheim, in the monotonous routine of a petty office, in the
service of a semi-military, semi-religious institution which had so
sunk in grandeur and power as to be little more than a venerable
name&mdash;a relic of the past. In the same service he had now returned
to Vienna. How Beethoven had been employed, and how
he had risen, we have seen. Thus, their relative positions in
society had completely changed. Beethoven now moved familiarly
in circles to which Breuning could have access only by his
or some other friend’s protection.</p>

<p>In view of the relation in which Wegeler stood to the Breuning
family, Beethoven might well have said more about “Steffen,”
but not easily less. Even here something of patronizing condescension
in the tone makes itself felt, which becomes far too<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
pronounced when he speaks of him in the second letter&mdash;that of
November. Reading these passages in connection with those
unlucky sentences in the Amenda letter, which have been censured
in another place, one feels that Breuning had been made sensible,
to a painful degree, how great his friend had grown. Wegeler
himself is struck by Breuning’s non-appearance at Beethoven’s
private concert, and remarks: “He must have felt his disappointment
with this old friend all the more, since Breuning
had been developed by Father Ries from an amateur to a most
admirable violinist, and had several times played in electoral
concerts.”</p>

<p>The more thoroughly the character of Breuning is examined,
not only in his subsequent relations to Beethoven but also in
the light of all that is known of him as a public official, as a husband,
father and friend, the higher he stands as a man. Under
circumstances, in his office, fitted to try his patience beyond the
ordinary limits of endurance, he never failed to bear himself
nobly, as a man of high principle, ever ready to sacrifice private
and personal considerations to the call of duty. In private life
he was invariably just, generous, tenacious of the right. Whatever
causes he may have had on divers occasions to complain
of Beethoven, we learn nothing of them from his correspondence
so far as it has been made public, unless a single passage cited by
Wegeler be thought an exception; yet this is but the expression
of heartfelt sorrow and compassion&mdash;not one word of anger. And
we know that Beethoven, when in distress, never turned to him
in vain for sympathy nor for such aid as was in his power to
give. In the miserable years to come the reader will learn enough
of Breuning, though by no means a prominent figure, to feel
respect and admiration for his character, and to see for himself
how unjust to him were those letters&mdash;written by Beethoven
under the impulse of short-lived choler&mdash;which Ries has contributed
to the “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Notizen</span>.” There is some temptation to think
that Breuning was of those whom Beethoven “estimated at only
what they were worth to him”; but let us trust that, should
ever the blanks in the Amenda letter be filled from the autograph,
his name will not be found&mdash;certainly not, if the conjecture as
to the time of Amenda’s residence in Vienna prove correct. It
is difficult to avoid saying either too much or too little on such a
topic as this of Breuning and Beethoven&mdash;to strike the just medium
in the strength of the language used; but the subject has been
made the occasion of so much injudicious comment, it was not
possible to pass it over.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span></p>

<p>VI. The “Intelligenz-Blatt” of Bonn, under date of November
30, 1784, announces the baptism, on the preceding day, of
Ferdinand, son of Franz Ries.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Like many others who have become eminent musicians, his taste
and capabilities manifested themselves very early; as, at five years old,
he began his musical education under his father, and afterwards under
Bernhard Romberg, the celebrated violoncello player.</p></div>

<p>The French invasion, the departure of Romberg in consequence
(1794) from Bonn, and the pecuniary straits to which
Franz Ries was reduced,</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>prevented much attention being, for some time, paid to the instruction
of his son.... At last, when he was about thirteen (“he had reached
the age of 13 years”, says the “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Rheinischer Antiquarius</span>”), a friend of his
father took him to Arnsberg in Westphalia, for the purpose of learning
thoroughbass and composition from an organ-player in that neighborhood....
The pupil proved so much the more able to teach of the
two, that the organist was obliged to give the matter up at once and
proposed to young Ries to teach him the violin instead. As a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pis-aller</i>,
this was accepted; and Ries remained at Arnsberg about nine months,
after which he returned home. Here he remained upwards of two years,
improving himself in his art with great industry.... At length, in
the year 1801, he went to Munich with the same friend who had formerly
taken him to Arnsberg. Here he was thrown upon his own resources;
and throughout the trying and dispiriting circumstances which, with
slight exception, attended the next years of his life, he appears to have
displayed a firmness, an energy, and an independence of mind, the more
honorable, perhaps, from the very early age at which they were called
into action. At Munich, Mr. Ries was left by his friend, with little
money and but very slender prospects. He tried for some time to procure
pupils, but was at last reduced to copy music at three-pence per
sheet. With this scanty pittance, he not only continued to keep himself
free from embarrassments, but saved a few ducats to take him to
Vienna, where he had hopes of patronage and advancement from Beethoven....
He set out from Munich with only seven ducats and
reached Vienna before they were exhausted!</p></div>

<p>The citations are from that noble musical journal the London
“Harmonicon,” and belong to an article on Ries published in
March, 1824. They correspond perfectly to a sketch of Ries’s
life in the “Rheinischer Antiquarius,” although there are sufficient
differences to show that the materials of the two articles were
drawn from independent sources. The “Antiquarius” (Part III,
Vol. II, p. 62), however, dates Ries’s arrival in Munich 1800, the
“Harmonicon” giving it 1801. But the difference is rather
apparent than real, since the winter of 1800-1801 includes them
both, and is therefore of very little import. But when Ries, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
the “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Notizen</span>” (p. 75), says: “On my arrival in <i>Vienna</i> in 1800,”
the discrepancy is one not to be passed over without investigation;
not that it is a matter of much interest in itself when a boy of
fifteen or sixteen years became a pupil of Beethoven, but because
of its bearing upon other and weightier questions in the chronology
of the master’s life and works. Which, then, is correct?</p>

<p>Ayrton, the editor of the “Harmonicon,” could have obtained
(in 1824) the date for his article only from Ries himself, as in
fact the internal evidence proves him to have done. It was published
after the announcement of Ries’s farewell concert in London,
with the evident intention of aiding in securing its success, and
must have been presented to Ries for revision before it was sent
to press. Ries, therefore, must have erred by a lapse of memory,
in 1824 as he admitted he may have done, or in December, 1837,
when he wrote the “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Notizen</span>.” As for the writer, he has no hesitation
in accepting September or October, 1801, as the date of
Ries’s advent in Vienna. Thus the last of these errors&mdash;that of
Wegeler in his date of the letter of June 29; that of Schindler
(in his first editions) in the date of the “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Christus am Ölberg</span>”;
and this of Ries&mdash;which had thrown all this period of Beethoven’s
history into a confusion that seemed inextricable, is satisfactorily
rectified, and the current of the narrative now flows as clear and
unimpeded here as in any other part.</p>

<p>Let us return to it. The “Harmonicon” proceeds:</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Beethoven and Ferdinand Ries</span></div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Ries’ hopes from his father’s early friend, were not disappointed;
Beethoven received him with a cordial kindness, too rare, alas! from men
who have risen to eminence and distinction towards those whose claim
upon them is founded on the reminiscences of their humble state. He
at once took the young man under his immediate care and tuition;
advanced him pecuniary loans, which his subsequent conduct converted
to gifts; and allowed him to be the first to take the title of pupil and
appear in public as such.</p></div>

<p>So also the “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Notizen</span>”:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In the letter of recommendation from my father there had been
opened a small credit account to be used in case of need. I never made
use of it but, when a few times Beethoven discovered that I was short of
funds, he sent me money without being asked and never wanted to take
it back. He was really very fond of me, of which fact he once in his
absent-mindedness gave me a very comical proof. Once when I returned
from Silesia, where I had spent some time at the country-seat of Prince
Lichnowsky as pianist on the recommendation of Beethoven, and entered
his room he was about to shave himself and had lathered his face up
to his eyes&mdash;for so far his fearfully stiff beard reached. He jumped up,
embraced me cordially and thereby transferred so much of the lather<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
from his left cheek to my right that he had none left. Did we laugh?
Beethoven must also have learned privately how matters had gone with
me; for he was acquainted with many of my youthful escapades, with
which he only teased me. In many cases he disclosed a really paternal
interest in me.</p></div>

<p>“But with all his kindness” continues the “Harmonicon,”</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Beethoven would not give Ries instruction in thoroughbass or composition.
He said it required a particular gift to explain them with
clearness and precision, and, besides that, Albrechtsberger was the
acknowledged master of all composers. This latter had almost given up
teaching, being very old, and was persuaded to take a new pupil only by
the strong recommendation of Beethoven and by the temptation of a
ducat a lesson. Poor Ries’ ducats ran only to the number of 28; after
this he was driven to his books again.</p></div>

<p>So it appears that he was Beethoven’s pupil only upon the
pianoforte. The manner in which he was taught is also described
in the “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Notizen</span>”:</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">The Recollections of Ries and Czerny</span></div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>When Beethoven gave me a lesson I must say that contrary to
his nature he was particularly patient. I was compelled to attribute
this and his friendly disposition, which was seldom interrupted, chiefly
to his great affection and love for my father. Thus, sometimes, he would
permit me to repeat a thing ten times, or even oftener. In the Variations
dedicated to the Princess Odescalchi (Op.&nbsp;34), I was obliged to repeat
the last <i>Adagio</i> variations almost entirely seventeen times; yet he was
still dissatisfied with the expression of the little cadenza, although I
thought I played it as well as he. On this day I had a lesson which
lasted nearly two hours. If I made a mistake in passages or missed
notes and leaps which he frequently wanted emphasized he seldom said
anything; but if I was faulty in expression, in <i>crescendos</i>, etc., or in the
character of the music, he grew angry because, as he said, the former was
accidental while the latter disclosed lack of knowledge, feeling, or attentiveness.
The former slips very frequently happened to him even when
he was playing in public.</p></div>

<p>“I often played on two fortepianos with Ries,” says Czerny,
“among other things the Sonata, Op.&nbsp;47, which had been arranged
for two pianofortes. Ries played very fluently, clear but cold.”<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a></p>

<p>Here we have a key to the identity of so many of Ries’s and
Czerny’s facts and anecdotes of those years, written out by them
independently; the latter, as he assures us, having first become
acquainted with the “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Notizen</span>” through the quotations of Court
Councillor Lenz. The two brilliant boys, thrown so much together,
would never weary of talking of their famous master. The stories
of his oddities and eccentricities, minute facts relating to his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
compositions, were, therefore, common property; and it is clear
that some which in this manner became known to Ries at last
assumed in his memory the aspect of personal experiences and,
as such, are related in the “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Notizen</span>.” The author of this work
once introduced an incident into something that he was writing,
under the full conviction of having been an actor in it, which he
now knows was only related to him by his brother. Yet only
some six or seven years had elapsed, whereas Ries wrote of a
period which ended thirty-five years before.</p>

<p>Another remark of Czerny’s is as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>When the French were in Vienna for the first time, in 1805, Beethoven
visited a number of officers and generals who were musical and
for whom he played Gluck’s “Iphigenia in Tauris” from the score, to
which they sang the choruses and songs not at all ill. I begged the
score from him and at home wrote out the pianoforte score as I had heard
him play it. I still have this arrangement (November, 1852). From
that time I date my style of arranging orchestral works, and he was
always wholly satisfied with my arrangements of his symphonies, etc.</p></div>

<p>A lad who, though not yet fifteen years old, was able to write
a pianoforte score of such an opera after a single hearing, certainly
deserved the testimonial to his talent which, though written by
another hand, was signed at the time by Beethoven and sealed.
The testimonial, in the possession of the <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Gesellschaft der Musikfreunde</span>
in Vienna, runs as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>We, the undersigned, cannot withhold from the lad Carl Czerny,
who has made such extraordinary progress on the pianoforte, far surpassing
what might be expected from a boy of fourteen years, that for
this reason, and also because of his marvelous memory, he is deserving of
all possible support, the more since his parents have expended their
fortune in the education of this promising son.</p>



<p class="sig">
Ludwig van Beethoven. (Seal)
</p>

<p class="date">
Vienna, December 7, 1805.
</p>

</div>

<p>The master had early and wisely warned him against a too
free use of his extraordinary memory. “My musical memory,”
Czerny writes,</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>enabled me to play the Beethovenian works by heart without exception,
and during the years 1801-1805 I was obliged to play these works in
this manner at Prince Lichnowsky’s once or twice a week, he calling out
only the desired opus number. Beethoven, who was present a few
times, was not pleased. “Even if he plays correctly on the whole,” he remarked,
“he will forget in this manner the quick survey, the <i>a vista</i>-playing
and, occasionally, the correct expression.”</p></div>

<p>Very neat is the anecdote which Czerny relates in the “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Wiener
Musikzeitung</span>” of September 28th, 1845, how, after he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
outgrown his studies, he was deservedly reprimanded for a few
additions which he made on his own account in one of his master’s
works.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>On the whole he was pleased with my performance of his works
... but he scolded me for every blunder with a kind freedom which
I shall never forget. When once, for instance, I played the Quintet with
Wind-Instruments with Schuppanzigh, I permitted myself, in a spirit of
youthful carelessness, many changes, in the way of adding difficulties to
the music, the use of the higher octave, etc.&mdash;Beethoven took me severely
to task in the presence of Schuppanzigh, Linke and the other players.
The next day I received the following letter from him, which I copy carefully
from the original draft:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="salut">“Dear Czerny:</p>

<p>“To-day I cannot see you, but to-morrow I will call on you myself
to have a talk with you. I burst forth so yesterday that I was sorry
after it had happened; but you must pardon that in an author who
would have preferred to hear his work exactly as he wrote it, no matter
how beautifully you played in general. I will make <i>loud</i> amends at the
Violoncello Sonata (I was to play his Violoncello Sonata with Linke the
next week). Be assured that as an artist I have the greatest wishes for
your success and will always try to show myself,</p>

<p class="sig">
Your<br />
true Friend<br />
Beethoven.”
</p></div>

<p>This letter did more than anything else to cure me of the desire
to make any changes in the performance of his works, and I wish that
it might have the same influence on all pianists.</p></div>

<p>In the letter dated November 16, Beethoven’s strong expressions
of desire and intention to exhibit his powers as pianist and
composer in other cities, are striking and worthy of the reader’s
attention, yet need no comment; but a new topic there introduced
must be treated at some length, not because it is of very great
importance in itself, but as an episode in the master’s life which
has employed so many pens and upon which biographer and
novelist seem to have contended which could make the most of
it and paint it in the highest romantic colors.<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a></p>

<p>The sentences referred to are: “I am living more pleasantly
since. I live more amongst men.... This change has been
wrought by a <i>dear fascinating</i> girl, etc.” Notwithstanding all
that has been written on this text there is little reason to think
that Beethoven’s passion for this particularly fascinating girl was
more engrossing or lasting than at other periods for others, although
peculiar circumstances subsequently kept it more alive in his
memory. The testimony of Wegeler, Breuning, Romberg, Ries,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
has been cited to the point that Beethoven “was never without
a love, and generally deeply engrossed in it.”</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In Vienna (says Wegeler) at least as long as I lived there, Beethoven
always had a love-affair on his hands, and occasionally made conquests
which, though not impossible, might have been difficult of achievement
to many an Adonis.... I will add that, so far as I know, every one
of his sweethearts belonged to the higher social stations.</p></div>

<p>So, also, friends of Beethoven with whom Jahn conversed
in 1852. Thus according to Carl Czerny he was said to have been
in love with a Countess Keglevics, who was not generally considered
handsome. The Sonata in E-flat, Op.&nbsp;7 (dedicated to her), was
called “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Die Verliebte</span>” (“The Maiden, or Woman, in Love”). Dr.
Bertolini, friend and physician of Beethoven from 1806 to 1816,
said: “Beethoven generally had a flame; the Countess Guicciardi,
Mme. von Frank, Bettina Brentano and others.” He was not
insensible to ladies fair and frail. Doležalek, a music teacher
who came to Vienna in 1800 and was the master’s admirer and
friend to the last, adds the particular that “he never showed that
he was in love.”</p>

<p>In short, Beethoven’s experience was precisely that of many
an impulsive man of genius, who for one cause or another never
married and therefore never knew the calm and quiet, but unchanging,
affection of happy conjugal life. One all-absorbing but
temporary passion, lasting until its object is married to a more
favored lover, is forgotten in another destined to end in like
manner, until, at length, all faith in the possibility (for them) of
a permanent, constant attachment to one person is lost. Such
men after reaching middle age may marry for a hundred various
motives of convenience, but rarely for love.</p>

<p>Upon this particular passion of Beethoven, the present writer
labors under the disadvantage of being compelled to subordinate
his imagination to his reason and to sacrifice flights of fancy
to the duty of ascertaining and imparting the modicum of truth
that underlies all this branch of Beethoven literature, of extracting
the few grains of wheat from the immense mass of chaff. With
what success remains to be seen.</p>

<p>When Schindler, in perusing the “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Notizen</span>,” came to the
passages above quoted, with his usual agility in jumping at conclusions
he decided at once, that Beethoven here refers to the
Countess Julia Guicciardi, and so states in his book; probably
hitting the truth nearer than on the next page, where he makes
Fräulein Marie Koschak the object of Beethoven’s “autumnal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
love,” some half a dozen years before the two had ever met. In
this case, however, there is no reason to suppose him mistaken.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Relations with the Countess Guicciardi</span></div>

<p>On the 16th of November, 1801&mdash;the date of Beethoven’s
letter&mdash;the Countess Guicciardi was just one week less than seventeen
years of age. She is traditionally described as having had a
good share of personal attractions, and is known to have been
a fine looking woman even in advanced years. She appears to
have possessed a mind of fair powers, cultivated and accomplished
to the degree then common to persons of her rank; but it is not
known that she was in any way eminently distinguished, unless
for musical taste and skill as a pianist, which may perhaps
be indicated in the dedication to her of a sonata by Kleinheinz
as well as by Beethoven.</p>

<p>Julia Guicciardi’s near relationship to the Brunswicks would
naturally throw her into the society of Beethoven immediately
upon the transfer of her father from Trieste to Vienna; their
admiration of his talents, their warm affection for him as a
man, would awaken her curiosity to see him and create a most
natural prejudice in his favor. Coming to the capital from a
small, distant provincial town when hardly of an age to enter
society, and finding herself so soon distinguished by the particular
attentions and evident admiration of a man of Beethoven’s social
position and fame, might well dazzle the imagination of a girl of
sixteen, and dispose her, especially if she possessed more than
common musical taste and talents, to return in a certain degree
the affection proffered to her by the distinguished author of the
Symphony, the Quartet, the Septet, the “Prometheus” music,
and so many wonderful sonatas, by the unrivalled pianist, the
generous, impulsive, enthusiastic artist, although unprepossessing
in person and unable to offer either wealth or a title. There
was romance in the affair. Besides these considerations there
are traditions and reminiscences of old friends of the composer
all tending to confirm the opinion of Schindler, that the
“fascinating girl” was indeed the young Countess Guicciardi.
That writer, however, knew nothing of the matter until twenty
years afterwards; but what he learned came from Beethoven
himself.</p>

<p>It happened, when the topic came up between them, “that,
being in a public place where he did not like to trust himself
to speak,” says Schindler, Beethoven also wrote his share in the
conversation, so far as it related to this subject; hence his words
may still be read in a Conversation Book of February, 1823,
preserved in the Royal Library at Berlin. His statements have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
certainly gained nothing in clearness from his whim of writing
them in part in bad French.</p>

<p>It is proper to state, before introducing the citation from
this book, that the young lady married Count Wenzel Robert
Gallenberg, a prolific composer of ballet and occasional music,
on the 3rd of November, 1803. The young pair soon left Vienna
for Italy and were in Naples in the spring of 1806; for Gallenberg
was one of the composers of the music for the fêtes, on the occasion
of Joseph Bonaparte’s assumption of the crown of the Two Sicilies.
When the Neapolitan Barbaja took charge of the R. I. Opera at
Vienna, toward the close of 1821, he made the Count an associate
in the administration, and thus it happened that Schindler had
occasion to call upon him with a message from Beethoven.</p>

<p>The Conversation Books of those years show, that the question
of selling the opera, “Fidelio,” to various theatres, was one often
discussed by Beethoven and his friends, and, also, that the author
had no complete copy of the score. It thus became necessary
to borrow one for the purpose of copying the whole or parts;
and at this point we turn to the Conversation Book. Schindler,
in the midst of a long series of remarks upon heterogeneous topics,
expresses surprise that the Dresden theatre has never purchased
“Fidelio,” and adds his opinion, that Weber will do all in his
power to further Beethoven’s interest, both in regard to the opera
and to the Mass in D. Then follows political news&mdash;Spain, England,
etc.&mdash;and the sale or hypothecation by Dr. Bach of certain
bank shares on which Beethoven wishes to raise money; and then:</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">A Conversation about the Countess</span></div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>Schindler</i>: Now as to “Fidelio”; what shall, what can I do to expedite
that?</p>

<p><i>Beethoven</i>: Steiner has the score.</p>

<p><i>Schindler</i>: I shall go to Count Gallenberg, who will lend it to you
for a time with pleasure. It would be best if you were to have it copied
at your own expense. You may ask 40 ducats. (After a farther remark
or two he promises to see Gallenberg “to-morrow morning”; some pages
farther is the report):</p>

<p><i>Schindler</i>: Gallenberg presents his compliments; he will send the
score, provided they have two copies. If this is not the case he will have
the score copied for you. I am to call on him again in two days. (The
conversation then turns upon copying certain songs and upon lithographing
the Mass in D; after which):</p>

<p><i>Schindler</i>: He (Gallenberg) did not inspire me with much respect
to-day.</p>

<p><i>Beethoven</i>: I was his invisible benefactor through others.</p>

<p><i>Schindler</i>: He ought to know that, so that he might have more
respect for you than he seems to have. (Kitchen affairs follow here for
a space; then Beethoven takes the pencil and writes):</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Beethoven</i>: So it seems you did not find G. favorably disposed toward
me; I am little concerned in the matter, but I should like to know
what he said.</p>

<p><i>Schindler</i>: He replied to me that he thought that you must have
the score yourself; but when I assured him that you did not have it he
said that its loss was a consequence of your irregular habits and many
changes of lodgings. What affair is that of the public? And, moreover,
who will care what such persons think? What have you decided to do
in the matter at Steiner’s? To keep quiet still longer? Dr. Bach
recently asked me about it. I thought you wanted to keep the score
because you had none. Do you want to give the five-part fugue also
for nothing? My dearest friend and master, that is too much generosity
towards such unworthy persons. You will only be laughed at. (Steiner
had bought some compositions of B. and not published them.)</p>

<p><i>Beethoven</i>: (having asked Schindler if he had seen Gallenberg’s wife,
proceeds): <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">J’étois bien aimé d’elle et plus que jamais son époux. Il
étoit pourtant plutôt son amant que moi, mais par elle j’apprenois de son
misère et je trouvais un homme de bien, qui me donnait la somme de 500 fl.
pour le soulager. Il étoit toujours mon ennemi, c’étoit justement la raison,
que je fusse tout le bien que possible.</i></p>

<p><i>Schindler</i>: It was for this reason that he added “He is an intolerable
fellow.” Probably because of pure gratitude. But forgive them, Lord,
they know not what they do. <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Est-ce qu’il y a longtemps qu’elle est mariée
avec Mons. de Gallenberg?&mdash;Mad. la Comtesse? Était-elle riche? Elle
a une belle figure jusqu’ici!</i></p>

<p><i>Beethoven</i>: <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Elle est née Guicciardi. Elle étoit l’épouse de lui avant
son voyage en Italie&mdash;arrivé à Vienne elle cherchoit moi pleurant, mais je la
méprisois.</i><a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a></p>

<p><i>Schindler</i>: Hercules at the crossways!</p>

<p><i>Beethoven</i>: And if I had wished to give my vital powers with that
life, what would have remained for the nobler, the better (things)?</p></div>

<p>Reverence for the composer, and admiration for his compositions,
must have led many who will read this to the perusal of
the constantly accumulating literature of which Beethoven and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
his works are the subject; and they must remember the prominence
accorded to the Guicciardi affair. Will they believe that all the
<i>established</i> facts, which have ever been made public, are exhausted
in these pages already? This is literally true. All else is but
conjecture or mistake. There is nothing in the present state
of knowledge on this subject to relieve the great mass of turgid
eloquence expended upon it from being described in one word as&mdash;nonsense.
The foundation for a tragedy is certainly small in a
case where the lover writes: “It is the first time that I feel as if
marriage <i>might</i> make me happy”; and immediately adds “now, of
course, I could not marry!” because the gratification of his
ambition was more to him than domestic life with the beloved one.</p>

<p>In November, 1852, Jahn had an interview with the Countess
Gallenberg. On so delicate a topic as Beethoven’s passion for
her fifty years before, reticence was natural; but had the affair in
truth been of the importance that others have given it, some hint
must have confessed it. Yet there is nothing of the kind in his
notes of the conversation. Here they are:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Beethoven was her teacher; he had his music sent to her and was
extremely severe until the correct interpretation was reached down to
the smallest detail; he laid stress upon a light manner of playing; he
easily became angry, threw down his music and tore it; he would take
no pay but linen, although he was very poor, under the pretence that the
Countess had sewed it. He also taught Princess Odescalchi and Baroness
Erdmann; sometimes he went to his pupils, sometimes they came to him.
He did not like to play his own compositions, but would only improvise.
At the slightest disturbance he would get up and go away. Count
Brunswick, who played the violoncello, adored him as did (also) his
sisters, Therese and Countess Deym. Beethoven had given her (the
Countess Guicciardi) the Rondo in G, but begged its return when he
had to dedicate something to the Countess Lichnowsky, and then dedicated
the Sonata to her. B. was very ugly, but noble, refined in feeling
and cultured.</p></div>

<p>In this simple record the lady’s memory evidently mistakes
by overrating the poverty of Beethoven at the time she was his
pupil and in making him then so negligent in dress. “In his
earlier years Beethoven dressed carefully, even elegantly; only later
did he grow negligent, which he carried to the verge of uncleanliness,”
says Grillparzer; and Czerny: “About the year 1813-’14,
when B. looked well and strong, he also cared for his outward
appearance.” But what a blow to all the supposed romantic
significance is the short, prosaic account of the dedication of the
C-sharp minor Sonata to her&mdash;a composition which was not a
favorite with the composer himself. “Everybody is always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
talking about the C-sharp minor Sonata! Surely I have written
better things. There is the Sonata in F-sharp major&mdash;that is
something very different,” he once said to Czerny.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">A Conjectural Offer of Marriage</span></div>

<p>There is but one well-authenticated fact to be added, namely,
that Beethoven kept up his intercourse with the family Guicciardi
certainly as late as May or June, 1823, that is, to within six months
of the young lady’s marriage. A careful survey and comparison
both of the published data and of the private traditions and hints
gleaned during a residence of several years at Vienna, result in
the opinion (an opinion, note, not a statement resting on competent
evidence) that Beethoven at length decided to offer Countess
Julia his hand; that she was not indisposed to accept it; and that
one of her parents consented to the match, but the other, probably
the father, refused to entrust the happiness of his daughter to a
man without rank, fortune or permanent engagement; a man,
too, of character and temperament so peculiar, and afflicted with
the incipient stages of an infirmity which, if not arrested and cured,
must deprive him of all hope of obtaining any high and remunerative
official appointment and at length compel him to abandon
his career as the great pianoforte virtuoso. As the Guicciardis
themselves were not wealthy, prudence forbade such a marriage.
Be all this as it may, this much is certain: Beethoven did not
marry the Countess Julia Guicciardi; Count Wenzel Robert
Gallenberg did. The rejected lover&mdash;true to a principle enunciated
in a letter to Zmeskall of March 29, 1799, “there is no use in
quarrelling with what cannot be changed”&mdash;made the best of it,
and went to work on the “Sinfonia eroica”!</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Schindler’s Unfounded Conclusions</span></div>

<p>Every reader acquainted with Schindler’s book will have
noticed that two grave matters, connected by him with the
Guicciardi affair, have been silently passed over, notwithstanding
the very great importance given to them by him and his copyists.
They must now be considered. Schindler’s honest and conscientious
desire to ascertain and impart the truth concerning Beethoven
admits no doubt. The spirit was willing, but his weakness as an
investigator was something extraordinary. His helplessness in
finding and following the clue out of a difficulty is something
pitiable, sometimes ludicrous. He reminds us, now and then, of
the character described by Addison: “He is perpetually puzzled
and perplexed amidst his own blunders.”</p>

<p>Take the present matter for an instance. In his first editions
of the biography the date given to the Guicciardi affair is
1806. With Wegeler’s letter before him giving him one fixed point&mdash;November,
1801&mdash;and the “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Gräfliches Taschenbuch</span>” to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
consulted in every respectable bookstore and public library for the
day of Gallenberg’s marriage, November 3, 1803, he is still at a loss.
“I had first to come to Paris, there make the acquaintance of
Cherubini, in order to hit, quite accidentally, upon a certain clue
for this date for which I had vainly searched in Vienna. Cherubini
and his wife, soon after their arrival in Vienna in 1805, heard of
this affair as of something that had happened two years before.”
Following this hint, in his edition of 1860, he changes the 1806
to 1803&mdash;that is, he adopts the new date because, twenty years
before, he heard from an old gentleman of 80 years and his wife,
nearly as old, that, thirty-five years before, they had heard that
some two years before that time Beethoven had been jilted! They
also “could say with certainty that the effect upon Beethoven’s
mood had already been overcome”;&mdash;which we are very willing to
hear from them, although the fact needed no confirmation. Again;
his conversation with Beethoven, given as an appendix to the
edition of 1845, was suppressed in the first because the Countess
Gallenberg was then living; the “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Taschenbuch</span>” would have
taught him that this objection remained in force until March
22nd, 1856! How is it possible to read with confidence the opinions
and statements of so helpless a writer&mdash;even when we grant him,
as we do Schindler, the utmost rectitude of intention&mdash;except
when he speaks from personal knowledge, or upon evidence
which he shows to be good?</p>

<p>Having in a manner so extraordinary fixed the date to his
satisfaction, Schindler proceeds to the catastrophe:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Yet touching the results of this break upon the spirits of our master,
so highly blessed by this love, something more may be said. In his
despair he sought comfort with his approved and particularly respected
friend Countess Marie Erdödy&mdash;at her country-seat at Jedlersee, in
order to spend a few days in her company. Thence, however, he disappeared
and the Countess thought he had returned to Vienna, when,
three days later, her music-master, Brauchle, discovered him in a distant
part of the palace gardens. This incident was long kept a close secret,
and only after several years did those familiar with it confide it to the
more intimate friends of Beethoven, long after the love-affair had been
forgotten. It was associated with a suspicion that it had been the purpose
of the unhappy man to starve himself to death. Those friends who made
close observation of the attitude of Beethoven towards the music-master
noticed that he treated him with extraordinary attention thereafter.</p></div>

<p>Jedlersee is so near Vienna, that a stout walker like Beethoven
would think nothing of the distance; and for <i>him</i> to obey
the whim or necessity of the moment, and disappear for two or
three days, is the very weakest of all grounds for the astounding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
conjecture here gravely related. But grant for a moment that
something of the kind, some time or other, really occurred; what
reason is there to suppose that it happened then, and in connection
with the Guicciardi matter? None, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Credat Judæus Apella, non
ego</i>. Indeed the whole story, whatever its date and connection,
is told on such mere hearsay evidence as would not justify the
police in arresting a beggar. To prevent it from passing into the
category of established facts&mdash;at least in connection with this
particular love-affair, and until some new and competent proof
be discovered&mdash;it may be remarked:</p>

<p>I. Schindler’s first knowledge of the passion of Beethoven for
Julia Guicciardi was obtained in 1823. Whatever he heard from
other sources could only have been afterwards; and in all probability
was after Beethoven’s death, when his attention was recalled
to the subject by a paper presently to be noticed. He does
not pretend to have heard this Jedlersee story from any party to
it; nor could he, for the Countess Erdödy had been banished from
the Austrian dominions long before it could have come to his
ears. He is, in fact and upon his own showing, gravely detailing
a mere private rumor, current (he says) among certain friends
of Beethoven, of an event which happened (if at all) fifteen,
twenty or thirty years before, and which was <i>surmised</i> by
them, or by him, to have occurred at the time he was jilted by
the young Countess Guicciardi.</p>

<p>II. There is nothing whatever in Ries’s reminiscences, most
of which are of the precise period of that affair, which, by any
stretch of fancy, can be made to confirm the story; nay, more,
they are utterly inconsistent with it. There is nothing even to
show that he ever observed that his master’s relations to the
Guicciardis were in any way remarkable; yet Beethoven’s inclination
to the society of women was a point in his character that
particularly impressed him. “Beethoven,” he says,</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>was fond of the company of women, especially if they had young and
pretty faces, and generally when we passed a somewhat charming girl
he would turn back and gaze at her through his glasses keenly, and laugh
or grin if he noticed that I was looking at him. He was frequently
in love, but generally only for a short period. Once when I twitted him
concerning his conquest of a pretty woman he admitted that she had
held him in the strongest bonds for the longest time, viz., fully seven
months.</p></div>

<p>III. And so too with Breuning. There is no letter, or part of
a letter by him (so far as made known by Wegeler), nor any tradition
derived from him, that relates to this passion or its supposed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
consequences; and yet, it is only from one of his letters that we
know of the proposal of marriage in 1810; nay, more, we shall
find, in 1803, Beethoven inviting a friend to dine with “Countess
Guicciardi,” at a time when he and Breuning lodged together!</p>

<p>IV. If the Jedlersee story be true at all in connection with
this particular lady, the time must have been 1803. But it is
totally inconsistent with what is known of the composer’s history
during that year.</p>

<p>V. Brauchle was not the Countess Erdödy’s music-teacher,
but the tutor of her children, in which capacity he could hardly
have been employed at a time when the eldest was not six years
of age! If we are correctly informed, he was not in that service
until after the year 1803; nor is it known that Beethoven’s intimacy
with the Countess had then been formed. In any case,
the starvation story may be considered as disposed of for the
present.</p>

<p>The force of these arguments will be incidentally but materially
increased by the views&mdash;if they find favor and acceptance&mdash;advanced
and supported in a short discussion of the single remaining
question belonging to the Guicciardi affair, to which we
now come.</p>

<p>It was well known to Beethoven’s friends, that he died possessed
of a few bank-shares; but where the certificates were deposited
neither his brother, Breuning nor Schindler knew. “B.
kept his bank-shares in a secret drawer of a cabinet known only
to Holz,” is one of Jahn’s notes of a conversation with Carl Holz.
When Schindler read Jahn’s manuscript notices and memoranda
upon Beethoven and added his comments, he remarked here:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Johann Beethoven first devoted himself to the disappearance of the
shares, and not finding them he cried out: “Breuning and Schindler
must find them.” Holz was asked to come, by Breuning, and requested
to say if he did not know where they were concealed. He knew the
secret drawer in the old cabinet in which they were kept.</p></div>

<p>In that “secret drawer” Breuning found not only the bank-certificates,
but also various “letters of importance to his friend,”
as Schindler describes them. One of these was a letter with two
postscripts written by Beethoven on two pieces of note-paper
with a lead pencil, at some watering-place not named, in the July
of a year not given and to a person not indicated. It is couched
in terms of enthusiastic love rarely equalled even in romance,
being like a translation into words of the most tender and touching
passages in his most impassioned musical compositions. This
document, placed in Schindler’s possession by Breuning, is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
original of what was first printed in 1840, as, “three autograph
letters written by Beethoven to his Giulietta from a bathing-place
in Hungary”<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> and which have so often been reprinted at
various times. The letter is as follows:</p>

July 6, in the morning.
</p>

<p>My angel, my all, my very self&mdash;only a few words to-day and at that
with pencil (with yours)&mdash;not till to-morrow will my lodgings be definitively
determined upon&mdash;what a useless waste of time. Why this deep
sorrow where necessity speaks&mdash;can our love endure except through
sacrifices&mdash;except through not demanding everything&mdash;can you change
it that you are not wholly mine, I not wholly thine. Oh, God! look
out into the beauties of nature and comfort yourself with that which
must be&mdash;love demands everything and that very justly&mdash;<i>thus it is with
me so far as you are concerned, and you with me</i>. If we were wholly united
you would feel the pain of it as little as I. My journey was a fearful
one; I did not reach here until 4 o’clock yesterday morning; lacking
horses the post-coach chose another route&mdash;but what an awful one. At
the stage before the last I was warned not to travel at night&mdash;made
fearful of a forest, but that only made me the more eager and I was
wrong; the coach must needs break down on the wretched road, a
bottomless mud road&mdash;without such postilions as I had with me I should
have stuck in the road. Esterhazy, travelling the usual road hitherward,
had the same fate with eight horses that I had with four&mdash;yet I got some
pleasure out of it, as I always do when I successfully overcome difficulties.
Now a quick change to things internal from things external. We shall
soon surely see each other; moreover, I cannot communicate to you
the observations I have made during the last few days touching my own
life&mdash;if our hearts were always close together I would make none of the
kind. My heart is full of many things to say to you&mdash;Ah!&mdash;there are
moments when I feel that speech is nothing after all&mdash;cheer up&mdash;remain
my true, my only treasure, my all as I am yours; the gods must send
us the rest that which shall be best for us.</p>

Your faithful Ludwig.

<p>You are suffering, my dearest creature&mdash;only now have I learned
that letters must be posted very early in the morning. Mondays,
Thursdays,&mdash;the only days on which the mail-coach goes from here to K.
You are suffering&mdash;Ah! wherever I am there you are also. I shall
arrange affairs between us so that I shall live and live with you, what a
life!!!! thus!!!! thus without you&mdash;pursued by the goodness of mankind
hither and thither&mdash;which I as little try to deserve as I deserve it.
Humility of man towards man&mdash;it pains me&mdash;and when I consider myself

the greatest&mdash;and yet&mdash;herein lies the divine in man. I weep when I
reflect that you will probably not receive the first intelligence from me
until Saturday&mdash;much as you love me, I love you more&mdash;but do not ever
conceal your thoughts from me&mdash;good-night&mdash;as I am taking the baths
I must go to bed. Oh, God! so near so far! Is our love not truly a
celestial edifice&mdash;firm as Heaven’s vault.</p>

<p class="dateline">
Good-morning, on July 7.</p>

<p>Though still in bed my thoughts go out to you, my Immortal
Beloved, now and then joyfully, then sadly, waiting to learn whether
or not fate will hear us. I can live only wholly with you or not at all&mdash;yes,
I am resolved to wander so long away from you until I can fly to
your arms and say that I am really at home, send my soul enwrapped in
you into the land of spirits.&mdash;Yes, unhappily it must be so&mdash;you will be
the more resolved since you know my fidelity&mdash;to you, no one can ever
again possess my heart&mdash;none&mdash;never&mdash;Oh, God, why is it necessary to
part from one whom one so loves and yet my life in W (Vienna) is
now a wretched life&mdash;your love makes me at once the happiest and the
unhappiest of men&mdash;at my age I need a steady, quiet life&mdash;can that be
under our conditions? My angel, I have just been told that the mail-coach
goes every day&mdash;and I must close at once so that you may receive
the L. at once. Be calm, only by a calm consideration of our existence
can we achieve our purpose to live together&mdash;be calm&mdash;love me&mdash;to-day&mdash;yesterday&mdash;what

<p>Among the many persons before whom at various times
Schindler kindly placed the original for examination were Otto
Jahn and the present writer, neither of whom ever discovered
any other reason to suppose this paper to have been intended
for the Countess Guicciardi than Schindler’s conjecture and the
grounds upon which he had formed it. Bearing in mind that the
existence of this paper was utterly unknown to either Breuning
or Schindler until after the death of its writer, who alone could
have imparted its history, the mental process by which it came to
be described in the words just quoted, “three autograph letters
written by Beethoven to his Giulietta from a bathing-place in
Hungary,” is perfectly easy to trace; thus:</p>

<p>In the first of the three parts, or letters, Beethoven speaks
of the very disagreeable journey which he had performed with
four post-horses, and Esterhazy with eight; in the second he writes
of the “mail-coach from here to K.” and again, “As I am taking
the baths I must go to bed.” Now, of the 218 places in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
Austrian postal-guide whose names begin with K, a large number
are in Hungary; the bathing-places in that kingdom are also
numerous; and Esterhazy’s possessions were there; hence
Schindler’s assumption that Beethoven wrote from a Hungarian
watering-place&mdash;which may stand for the present. His conjecture
as to whom he wrote was of course suggested by his conversation
in 1823 upon the Countess Gallenberg. This assumption, so
obvious and natural for him to make that it was accepted unquestioned
and even unsuspected for thirty years, must nevertheless
be tested.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">When Was the Love-Letter Written?</span></div>

<p>The document presents three incomplete dates, the year being
omitted in each:</p>

<div class="container">
<p class="centerpara">
“July 6, in the morning.”<br />
“Evening, Monday, July 6.”<br />
“Good-morning on July 7.”
</p></div>

<p>A reference to the almanacs of 1795, 1801, 1807, and 1812,
shows that July 6th fell upon a Monday in those years. The
year 1795 is of course excluded, for Julia Guicciardi had not then
completed her eleventh year, and we turn at once to 1801. The
main subjects of Beethoven’s letter to Wegeler of June 29th were
his ailments and the modes of treatment adopted by his medical
advisers; to which he adds his desire for his friend’s counsel,
Wegeler being a physician of eminent ability and skill. It was
Wegeler’s reply which drew forth the second letter of November
16, only four and a half months after the first, which continues
the subject with equal minuteness of detail. If now the reader
will turn back and carefully reperuse the two, he will see that all
possibility of a journey to some distant watering-place, requiring
the use of four post-horses, whether in Hungary or elsewhere, in
the interval between those letters is absolutely excluded by their
contents. The conclusion is unavoidable that the diary was not
written in 1801.</p>

<p>But may there not be an error either in the day of the month
or of the week in the words: “Evening, Monday, July 6?” If there
be, the inquiry is extended to the years 1800 and 1802.</p>

<p>On July 6th, 1800, the Guicciardi family had hardly reached
Vienna from Trieste. But suppose Julia had been previously
sent thither to complete her education, and thus had become
known to Beethoven. In that case, what is to be thought of
guardians and friends who could allow her such liberty, or rather
license, that she, at the age of fifteen and three-quarter years,
should already have formed the relations necessarily implied by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
the language of the diary with a man twice her age? What,
too, must be thought of Beethoven! Granting him to have been,
as Magdalena Willmann and others said, “half crazy,” the man
certainly was not a fool!</p>

<p>The year 1800 may also be safely discarded. As to 1802, it
is superfluous to say more than that in the next chapter will be
found part of a letter by Beethoven, dated “Vienna, July 13, 1802.”
His stay at the bath must, indeed, have been short if he reached
it with four post-horses on the 5th and is in Vienna again writing
letters on the 13th!</p>

<p>In 1803, July 6th fell upon Wednesday. But there was no
such error in the date; Beethoven gives the day of the month
three times in twenty-four hours&mdash;twice on the 6th, once on the
7th. A mistake here is inconceivable. The day of the week,
indeed, is written but once; but then it is Monday, and Sunday
and Monday are precisely the two days of the week which one
most rarely or never mistakes. But that part of the document
which bears the date “Evening, Monday, July 6” contains certain
words that are decisive. This part is a postscript to the writing
of the morning and is written, he says, because he was too late
for the post on that day, and “Mondays, Thursdays, the only
days on which the mail-coach goes from here to K.” The conclusion
is irresistible: Schindler and his copyists are all wrong;
the document was not written in the years 1800-1803; the “Immortal
Beloved” for whom it was written was <i>not</i> the Countess Julia
Guicciardi. Therefore, they who have wept in sympathy over
this Werther’s sufferings caused by this Charlotte, may dry their
tears. They can comfort themselves with the assurance, that the
catastrophe was by no means so disastrous as represented. The
affair was but an episode; not the grand tragedy of Beethoven’s
life. But, being a love adventure, it has been treated with fact
in ratio to fancy like Falstaff’s bread to his sack. One author
in particular, who accepts all Schindler’s assumptions and conjectures
without question or suspicion, has elaborated the topic
at great length, though perhaps (to borrow Sheridan’s jest) less
luminously than voluminously. Having wrought up the feelings
of “his lovely readers, his dear lady friends of Beethoven,” to the
highest pitch possible in a tragedy where the hero, after the
catastrophe, still lives and prospers, he consoles them a few chapters
farther on by giving to Beethoven for his one “Love’s Labor Lost”
two new ones gained&mdash;the one, a married woman, the other, a
young girl of fourteen years; and, moreover&mdash;if, in the confusion
of his dates, the reader is not greatly misled&mdash;both at the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
time! “Also the Lord gave Job twice as much as he had before,”
saith the ancient Hebrew poet.<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a></p>

<p>Even if one were disposed to attach no great importance to
the arguments thus far advanced, there are two passages in the
letter which could not have been written in that brilliant period
of Beethoven’s life (1800-1802) and therefore are conclusive; viz.:
“My life in W (Wien = Vienna) is now a wretched life,” and “At
my age I need a quiet, steady life.” In fact, the severest critical
discussion of my argument against the accuracy of Schindler’s
statement has failed to find a flaw in it beyond the unessential
assertion that Beethoven could scarcely be conceived as having
erred in the matter of the day of the week. Since then the author
has himself accidentally learned by experience how a mistake of
this kind, made in the morning, can easily be perpetuated in
private letters; he learned it by being compelled to prove the
absolute accuracy of an official document.</p>

<p>Every attentive and thoughtful reader of the letter must
realize that it is irreconcilable with the notion that Beethoven’s
passionate devotion to the lady was a new and sudden one; also
that Beethoven had parted with his beloved, whoever she may
have been, only a short time before; that he writes in the full
conviction that his love is returned and the desire for a union of
their fates was mutual, and that by patient waiting the obstacles
then in the way of their purpose to live together would be overcome.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Beethoven’s Inaccurate Datings</span></div>

<p>In the effort to determine when Beethoven wrote in this strain
his own inaccurate dates cannot be overlooked, but must be discussed
at the outset of the inquiry. If the words “Evening, Monday,
July 6,” are to be considered conclusive, the investigation will
have to be confined to the years 1807 and 1812, both 1801 and 1818
being out of the question. But if an error of a day be assumed, inquiry
may be extended to the following years. In the first three years</p>


<div class="center">
<table class="tdl" border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td>&nbsp;</td><th>1805</th><th>1807</th><th>1808</th></tr>

</table></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span></p>

<p>To pass by other reasons, the years 1808 and 1811 are to be
excluded because they presuppose an error of two days. There
remain, then, the years 1806, 1807, 1812 and 1813, which can be
best studied in their reverse order. The year 1813 shows itself
at once impossible because of the date of a letter to Varena:
“Baden, July 4, 1813,” besides other circumstances which prove
that Beethoven spent the months of June and July of this year
in Vienna and Baden. In a similar manner 1812 must be rejected
because he wrote a letter to Baumeister on June 28 from Vienna
and arrived in Teplitz on July 7.</p>

<p>There remain, then, only the years 1806 and 1807. If we
are willing to attach too great weight to the improbability of an
error in Beethoven’s dates (July 6 and 7) it would certainly be
impossible to decide in favor of the year for which other considerations
plead with almost convincing force&mdash;viz., 1806. There is a
letter from Beethoven to Brunswick proposing to visit him in
Pesth <i>printed</i> with the date “May 14, 1806” which might be
strong evidence in favor of that year; but, unfortunately, the true
date is 1807, and so adds to our difficulty. For it is known that
on July 22nd, 1807 (and for several days at least before), he was
in Baden, and there is nothing thus far to prove that he did not
make the proposed visit and return from Hungary in season to
have written the love-letter on the 6th and 7th of that month;
this is, it is true, a very unsatisfactory assumption. There is a
date in a correspondence with Simrock touching the purchase
of certain works, which, if it could be established with certainty,
would remove all doubt and provide a satisfactory conclusion. If
the correspondence took place in 1806 it would be impossible to
avoid the unsatisfactory assumption.</p>

<p>The head of the famous house of Simrock once told the
author that the letters written to his father by Beethoven had been
stolen (they have since been recovered), and that the only possible
information on the point might be obtained from the old business
books of the house. The author asked that they be examined
for him and his request was most courteously complied with, with
the result that he was provided with the excerpts from the letters
of which he has made use in a later chapter. To his great satisfaction
the most important of the letters bears date May 31, 1807.
This and the letter following show that Beethoven spent the
months of June and July 1807 in Baden.</p>

<p>The result would, then, seem to be irrefutable:&mdash;there is an
error of one day in Beethoven’s date. The letter was written in
the summer which he spent partly in Hungary, partly in Silesia&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span><i>the
summer of 1806</i>. In all the years from 1800 to 1815 there
is no other summer in which he might have written the letter
within the first ten days of July unless we choose to assume a
state of facts which would do violence to probability.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Beethoven’s Moral Character Vindicated</span></div>

<p>But our contention has a much more serious purpose than
the determination of the date of a love-letter; it is to serve as
the foundation for a highly necessary justification of Beethoven’s
character at this period in his life. The editor of Beethoven’s
letters to Gleichenstein which appeared in “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Westermann’s
Monatsheften</span>” (1865)<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> learned from Gleichenstein’s widow that
the composer had once made a proposal of marriage to her sister
Therese Malfatti. On the strength of this information, and certain
references in the letters themselves, the editor founded a singular
theory;&mdash;Beethoven, says the editor in question, fell in love with
“the dark-brown Therese,” who, despite the fact that she was
“then only 14 years old (in 1807), was fully developed.” “His
love for her was as rapid in its growth as it was in its passionateness,
but <i>was not returned then or later</i>.” “The affair was plainly embarrassing
to the family, for the passion of the half-deaf, very eccentric
man of 36 for a girl of fourteen could not fail in the long run to
become dangerous (<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">misslich</i>).”</p>

<p>“Why, very well; I hope here be truths,” as the <i>Fool</i> says
in “Measure for Measure.”</p>

<p>Reflect that this was the year of the Mass in C and the C
minor Symphony, and imagine the picture: Beethoven, the mighty
master, occupied in developing works which stirred the deepest
depths of the soul. Such on one hand; on the other “the lover,
sighing like a furnace, with a woeful ballad made to his mistress’
eyebrow.” Or, if one prefer, instead of the first picture, a half-deaf,
eccentric, 36-year old Corydon, wandering about by the
side of mossy brooks vainly piping tunes to a melancholy early-developed
and early-loved Phyllis! Let us admit for the nonce
that the amiable picture of Beethoven in 1807 is the correct one;
there is yet no excess of reason based on sense or probability, no
boundlessness of imagination or immature logic which can assert
that the letter of July 6 and 7 was written to Therese Malfatti,
then 13 years old.</p>

<p>There is still another assumption or suspicion which must
be touched upon here and if possible refuted; it is that, even in
1806, Beethoven’s letter was addressed to the Countess Guicciardi,
then already the wife of Count Gallenberg. Moreover, a more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
natural solution of the difficulties could scarcely be found if it
could but be proved or accepted as true that the composer was
one of those exalted musical geniuses, recently lauded by a writer,
who are “no longer subject to once accepted notions of morals
and ordinary duties,” and who refuse to permit “narrow-minded
ethics to be lifted to the real laws of existence.” If Beethoven had
been a man of this character, what more should we need to believe
that in the summer of 1806 he and the lady were impatiently
awaiting the moment when they might steal away from husband
and children and thus attain “their purpose to live together,”
heart closely pressed to heart? Here a single objection will
suffice: Count Gallenberg and his wife had at this time long
been in Naples. No! This disgrace does not attach to the name
of Beethoven.</p>

<p>Those who have thought it worth while to follow the discussion
thus far will now understand why so much time and labor
were spent on removing all doubt as to the dates of the letters
of June 29, 1801, and July 6 and 7, 1806, and this after a long
time had passed during which there had never arisen a doubt in
the mind of the writer. For if these dates remain fixed, the
extended romantic structures which have been reared on the
sandy foundation of conjecture must fall in ruins.</p>

<p>The conclusions reached by the study seem as natural as
they are satisfactory and indubitable. Young Beethoven, possessed
of a temperament susceptible and excitable in the highest
degree and endowed not only with extraordinary genius but,
leaving out of consideration his physical misfortunes, with other
attractive qualities&mdash;the great pianist, the beloved teacher, the
highly promising composer, admired and accepted gladly in the
highest circles of society of the metropolis&mdash;this Beethoven, as
Wegeler expresses it, was always in love and generally in the
highest degree. As he took on years, however, his passions
cooled, and it is a truth of daily observation that at the last a
strong and lasting attachment can obtain mastery over the most
vacillating and fickle lover. According to our conviction this was
also the case with Beethoven, and most assuredly the famous
love-letter was addressed to the object of a wise and honorable
love which had taken control over him. If this be true, and if
he was so violently in love in 1806, it follows that the references
in the Gleichenstein correspondence which their editor applies to
a “completely developed girl of fourteen years of age,” in 1807,
were aimed at an entirely different individual; and this, too, is the
conviction of the author.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span></p>

<p>But who is the lady? it is asked.<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> The secret was too well
guarded; and she is still unknown. This, only, is certain: that</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">The Countess Therese von Brunswick</span></div>

<p>1st. Of all Beethoven’s friends and acquaintances of the
other sex whose names are on record one only could have been the
“Immortal Beloved” of the letter and the party to this project
of marriage; 2nd, all the circumstantial evidence points to her
and to her only; 3rd, long after these two points were determined,
Robert Volkmann, the fine musician and composer, in conversation
with the author, mentioned a local tradition at Pesth which
directly names her as having been once the beloved and even
(if our memory serve) the bride <i>in spe</i> of Beethoven. This lady
was the Countess Therese von Brunswick.</p>

<p>The scattered notices of the Brunswicks in these volumes,
if taken connectedly, may appear of deeper significance than has
been suspected. They were of the earliest and warmest friends
of Beethoven in Vienna; they “adored him,” said their cousin,
the Countess Gallenberg; Beethoven wrote the song “Ich denke
dein” in the album of the sisters and dedicated it to them when
he published it in 1805; he received from Therese her portrait
in oil;<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> visited the Brunswicks in the autumn of 1806 and composed
the Sonata, Op.&nbsp;57, which he dedicated to the brother; and immediately
after his departure wrote the passionate love-letter,&mdash;to
whom?&mdash;wrote to Count Franz, “Kiss your sister Therese,” and
in the autumn of 1809, while on another visit to them, composed
the Sonata, Op.&nbsp;78, dedicated to the sister. A few months later
the marriage project fell through.</p>

<p>Two remarks may be noted here which, if of no great importance,
are worth the space they will occupy: 1st. After the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
appearance of the dedication of Op.&nbsp;78, Therese von Brunswick’s
name disappears from all papers, notes and memoranda concerning
Beethoven collected by Jahn or the author; yet the friendship
between him and the brother remained undisturbed. 2nd. This
friendship of thirty years’ duration was broken only by death; yet,
although in the later years long periods of separation were frequent,
their known epistolary correspondence is comprised in some half
dozen letters, and the half of these with false dates. Were these
all? If not, why should all, except just these which are neither
of particular interest nor importance, have been destroyed or
concealed? Unless, indeed, there was a secret to be preserved.
Therese von Brunswick lived to a great age, having the reputation
of a noble and generous but eccentric character. In regard to
Beethoven, so far as is known, she, like Shakespeare’s <i>Cardinal</i>,
“died and made no sign.” Because she could not?<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a></p>

<h3>(Postscript by the Editor of the English Edition.)</h3>

<p>There are other candidates than the Countesses Guicciardi
and Brunswick for the honor of having been the object of what,
it must be admitted, was Beethoven’s supreme love;&mdash;or, at least,
there are other women for whom writers have put in pleas.
Though Dr. Kalischer professed to believe that he had effectually
disposed of the Thayer hypothesis, it is significant that by far
the most notable champions who fought for their respective lady-loves
are those who entered the lists for the Countess Therese.
I mention only the American Thayer; the Englishman Grove; the
Germans La Mara, Storck, and Prelinger (like Kalischer, the
editor of a collection of Beethoven’s letters); the Frenchmen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
Rolland and Chantavoine, both biographers of Beethoven.
Schindler, Nohl and Kalischer carried the sleeve of the Countess
Guicciardi; Frimmel and Volbach seemed gently inclined to
Magdalena Willmann, the actress who said that Beethoven wanted
to marry her but she would not have him because he was so ugly
and “half crazy”; Dr. Wolfgang A. Thomas-San-Galli is the
champion of Amalia Sebald as the “Immortal Beloved” and of
1812 as the year in which the love-letter was written. Of his
book (“<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Die Unsterbliche Geliebte Beethovens, Amalia Sebald</span>,”
Halle, 1909) it may be said that its merit lies in its close, pertinent
and dispassionate reasoning&mdash;the quality in which all of Dr.
Kalischer’s arguments are most deficient.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Dr. Kalischer’s Defence of Schindler</span></div>

<p>Schindler’s story touching the letter and Giulietta Guicciardi
was unquestioned for thirty years, when doubt was cast upon it
by Thayer’s investigations, which fixed the date as 1806 and
thereby eliminated the Countess as the composer’s inamorata.
In Vol. II, Thayer contented himself with a demonstration that
the Countess could not be the “Immortal Beloved.” In Vol. III,
in the body of the book, he suggested that in “greatest probability”
the lady was the Countess Therese von Brunswick. It does not
appear that he ever went further than this, but he died, in 1897,
in full conviction that by no possibility could the Guicciardi be
rehabilitated in the place she had so long occupied in the minds of
historians and romancers. His first contribution to the question
(the first portion of this chapter) immediately called forth a
defence of Schindler’s story, Dr. Alfred Christian Kalischer being
in the van of Schindler’s defenders. Instead of traversing the
evidence in the case as Thayer had done, Kalischer proposed
and followed the “inductive method” thus: Beethoven could not
have indulged in such transports at as late a date as 1806 or 1807.
They were the outpourings of a sentimentalist, one of the
Werther sort. Beethoven had said in the letter that he could
only live wholly with his love or not at all&mdash;an expression not to
be thought of in connection with a genius who had created the
“Eroica” symphony, “Fidelio,” the Sonatas in D minor and F
minor (Op.&nbsp;57), the Pianoforte Concertos in C minor and G major,
the Quartets, Op.&nbsp;59, had finished the fourth Symphony and
sketched the C minor and the “Pastoral”&mdash;could such a genius
believe for a moment that he could not live without the object
of his love? etc. The whole argument was merely rhetoric and
psychologically speculative.</p>

<p>In a criticism of Thayer’s third volume, written for “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Der
Clavierlehrer</span>” in 1879, Kalischer took up the subject of Therese<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
Brunswick and, pursuing his old style of argumentation, urged
that the “Immortal Beloved” was Giulietta and not Therese
because, forsooth, Beethoven had dedicated the C-sharp minor
Sonata to the former and nothing better than the Sonata in F-sharp
major, Op.&nbsp;78, composed in 1809, to the latter. Kalischer
saw no force in the fact that sketches for the so-called “Moonlight”
Sonata antedated the dedication by a considerable period; the
essential things in his mind were the dedication and that Lenz
thought highly of the C-sharp minor and little of the Fantasia
for Pianoforte, Op.&nbsp;77, dedicated by Beethoven “to his friend”
Brunswick, and still less of the F-sharp Sonata dedicated to
“another member of the house of Brunswick”; and that while
Marx had described the C-sharp minor Sonata as “the low hymn
of love’s renunciation” he did not consider the F-sharp major
Sonata as worthy even of mention.</p>

<p>These essays, together with another in which Dr. Kalischer
performed with great energy the work of disposing of the romantic
vaporings of a writer who called herself Mariam Tenger, who
had published a book (“<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Beethoven’s Unsterbliche Geliebte, nach
persönlichen Erinnerungen</span>”) at Bonn in 1890, in which she affected
to prove what Thayer had set down as merely a probability. This
writer (who had most obviously taken her cue from Thayer,
though she protested that she had not read his biography when
she wrote her book) professed to have had the tale from the lips
of the Countess Brunswick herself, that Beethoven, while visiting
at Martonvásár, the country-seat of the Brunswicks, in May,
1806, had become secretly engaged to the Countess, no one else
knowing the fact except Beethoven’s friend Count Franz von
Brunswick. Dr. Kalischer found little difficulty in demolishing
a large portion of the fantastic fabric reared by Mariam Tenger,
especially that portion which professed to rest upon the alleged
testimony of a “Baron Spaun” who was plainly a creation of
the romancer’s, though a veritable Spaun did figure, largely and
creditably, in the life-history of Schubert. Not content with this
the critic went further, and reviewing the sentimental career of
Beethoven from 1806 to 1810 (in which latter year it is supposed
the relations between him and the Countess Brunswick came to
an end), he protested that, in 1807, Beethoven was in love with
Therese Malfatti, then a girl of 14 years.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">La Mara and the Countess Therese</span></div>

<p>That question had already been discussed by Thayer, as we
have seen. So also had the identity of Baron Spaun by Marie
Lipsius, known in musical literature by her pen-name La Mara,
who called attention to inaccuracies in the Tenger story in the first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
of a collection of essays entitled “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Classisches und Romantisches
aus der Tonwelt</span>,” published in Leipsic in 1891. The same
author who, in all her writings on the subject, has stoutly maintained
the correctness of Thayer’s theory, made the most valuable
contribution yet offered to the controversy by her book, “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Beethoven’s
Unsterbliche Geliebte. Das Geheimniss der Gräfin
Brunsvick und ihre Memoiren</span>,” published by Breitkopf and
Härtel in 1909. To this book it is necessary to pay rather extended
attention; but before its contents are passed in review it deserves
to be noted that Thayer, who followed the multitude of arguments
for and against his hypothesis with the greatest interest and with a
characteristically open mind, went down to his grave with his
strong conviction unshaken that “in greatest probability” the
Countess Therese was the “Immortal Beloved.” To La Mara he
sent a letter dated January 22, 1892, to which attention was
called in a foot-note on the history of the C-sharp minor Sonata
in an earlier chapter of this work, and which, through the
courtesy of the lady to whom it was addressed, is now given in
substance:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>... That Mr. Kalischer has adopted Ludwig Nohl’s strange notion of
Beethoven’s infatuation for Therese Malfatti, a girl of <i>fourteen years</i>,
surprises me; as also that he seems to consider the Cis moll Sonata to
be a musical love poem addressed to Julia Guicciardi. He ought certainly
to know that the subject of that Sonata was, or rather that it
was suggested by, Seume’s little poem “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Die Beterin</span>.”</p>

<p>I pray you to stop here and read before proceeding the first part
of the <i>Liebesbrief</i>. Note well that it was written from a <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Badeort</i> so
far away from Vienna that he journeyed thither in a coach with four
horses and Esterhazy with eight. And now to the essential points.</p>

<p>During the summer of 1801, we know that Beethoven lodged in
Hetzendorf&mdash;where ex-Kurfürst Franz resided and died July 26, that
year&mdash;and composed his “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Christus am Ölberg</span>” in great part in the near
Schönbrunn garden. We know that he wrote on June 29, a very full
account of his increasing deafness to Dr. Wegeler. Was he, only seven
days later, in a distant <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Badeort</i>, writing <em>such</em> a love-letter to a young
<i>Gräfin</i> not yet seventeen years old? In November he again wrote to
Wegeler. “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Du willst wissen</span>,” he says, “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">wie es mir geht, was ich brauche</span>,”
and proceeds to describe his physician’s treatment. In neither of these
letters is there the remotest hint that the doctor sent him to a distant
<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Badeort</i>. In 1802, Beethoven’s summer lodging was in Heiligenstadt
where young Ries came often to receive his master’s instructions. There
is not the slightest intimation from him, nor anywhere else, of any absence
of Beethoven during that summer. Did Beethoven write the <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Liebesbriefe</i>
in July and the so-called Testament&mdash;that document of despair&mdash;in
October? Observe these dates. In the <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Liebesbriefe</i> from the <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Badeort</i>
July 6: <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Ich kam erst Morgens 4 Uhr gestern hier an.</span>” Seven days
later, July 13, he was in Vienna writing to Breitkopf and Härtel!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span></p>

<p>In the Testament we read: <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Dieses halbe Jahr was ich auf dem
Lande zubrachte</span>,” but in no known letter or writing of Beethoven’s
of that summer is there any reference to the distant <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Badeort</i>.</p>

<p>All that is known of Beethoven in the summer of 1801 and 1802, is
against the journey to the <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Badeort</i>; what is known of the summer of 1806
is for it. The burden of proof lies upon Mr. Kalischer. When he <i>can</i>
prove such a journey in 1801 or 1802, and does so, it will be <i>one</i> point
in his favor.</p></div>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Testimony of Friends and Relations</span></div>

<p>The method pursued by La Mara in her investigation, which
extended over several years, was much like that of Thayer: in
every case in which it seemed that testimony might be had from
the mouths of living persons she sought to obtain it. First she
visited the Countess Marie Brunswick (or Brunsvik, as the Hungarian
branch of the Braunschweigers, or Brunswicks, spelled the
name), daughter of Count Franz. There was an interview followed
by a correspondence. The Countess said that the family knew
nothing whatever of the alleged romantic attachment between her
aunt and Beethoven. She recalled that Beethoven had a “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">grosse
Schwärmerei</span>” for her father’s cousin, the Countess Guicciardi,
afterwards Gallenberg, but the feeling was not reciprocated on
the part of the Countess so far as had been learned. The family
was still in possession of three or four letters from Beethoven to
her father. In November, 1899, she sent four letters to La Mara
which were then owned by her brother, Count Géza Brunswick.
Three of these letters had already been printed in the first edition
of this biography. The only one bearing on the subject of this
study was that in which Beethoven begs the Count to kiss his
sister Therese. (This letter La Mara presents in <i>facsimile</i> in
her book.) Count Gallenberg (son of the Countess Giulietta and
the last of the family) had died in Vienna in 1893, two years
after he had denied that there had been any talk of marriage
or <i>mutual</i> love between his mother and Beethoven. The testimony
of two grand-children of the Countess Giulietta was asked. “Beethoven
wanted to marry grandmamma,” said the Countess Bertha
Kuenburg, <i>née</i> Countess Stolberg-Stolberg, in Salzburg, “but she
loved Gallenberg.” Baroness Hess-Diller, <i>née</i> Countess Gallenberg,
in Baden said:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Among our family papers there is absolutely nothing bearing on
the matter&mdash;<i>no</i> letters, <i>no</i> diary. The prejudices of the period, the
incredible point of view held by persons of our station towards artists, even
towards artists of Beethoven’s greatness, may have been responsible for
the fact that no interest was felt in the matter. All that verbal tradition
has brought down to me is summed up in the one circumstance that
Beethoven figured only as a music-teacher in the house of my great-grand-parents.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span></p>

<p>On the suggestion of the grand-children of the Countess
Giulietta, La Mara called on Fräulein Karoline Languider, a life-long
friend of the Gallenbergs, who had lived with them and the
Countess Marie Brunswick. This witness testified:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I do not believe that the <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Schwärmerei</i> for Countess Julia Gallenberg-Guicciardi&mdash;though
it may have been warm and wonderful, for
she was a very beautiful, elegant woman of the world&mdash;ever took such
possession of the heart of Beethoven as did the later love for Countess
Therese Brunsvick, which led to an engagement. That was decidedly
his profoundest love, and that it did not result in marriage, it is
said, was due to the&mdash;what shall I call it?&mdash;real artistic temperament
(<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Natur</i>) of Beethoven, who, in spite of his great love, could not make
up his mind to get married. It is said that Countess Therese took it
greatly to heart. Having lived during my childhood with my parents
in Pressburg, I often heard&mdash;with childish ears, of course&mdash;persons speak
about the matter, and am able to remember that Countess Therese was
greatly beloved, and that my mother was always very glad when she
came to Pressburg, which was every year.</p></div>

<p>La Mara having sent Fräulein Languider some of her writings
and a copy of Lampi’s portrait of the Countess Therese, she wrote
on January 24, 1901: “After all that has been said <i>pro</i> and <i>contra</i>
I remain of the unalterable opinion that the Countess Therese
was the ‘Immortal Beloved’ and fiancée of the great master,
concerning which fact I heard innumerable conversations in my
childhood, and that the portrait is hers. Countess Marie does not
see a resemblance, but I do not trust her memory.” Countess
Marie Brunswick had said to La Mara that she did not consider
the painting which is now preserved in the Beethovenhaus in
Bonn a portrait of her aunt; “but,” says La Mara, “since there
was a difference of 57 years, she could no longer judge of a likeness
with the youthful picture.”</p>

<p>Count Géza Brunswick, son of Beethoven’s friend, died in
the spring of 1902, having outlived his sister Marie. The direct
line of Brunswicks reached its end in him. The castles Korompa
and Martonvásár passed into other hands. Count Franz’s art
collection was sold at auction in Vienna, but the widow of Count
Géza retained possession of the Beethoven relics (the letters and
an oil portrait) and took them with her to Florence, where subsequently
she married the Marchese Capponi. She, too, gave
her testimony: “It is certain that there were soul-relationships
between Beethoven and Therese Brunsvik.”</p>

<p>Next, La Mara went to Pressburg (in search of such traditions
as Thayer had found in Pesth), working on the hint thrown out
by Fräulein Languider. In Pressburg she met Johann Batka,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
municipal archivist, who bore testimony to the fact that a relative
of the Countess Therese Brunswick, who was in possession of her
memoirs (a copy, evidently, since La Mara obtained the original
from the family of Count Deym), had persuaded him to believe
that Therese was the “Immortal Beloved” and secret fiancée of
Beethoven. After La Mara had published the results of her
investigation in the January number for 1908 of the “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Neue Rundschau</span>,”
the grand-niece of Countess Therese, Isabella, Countess
Deym, and her sister Madame Ilka Melichar, confirmed the
statement that the letter had been addressed to their illustrious
grand-aunt. An estrangement had sprung up between Count
Franz and his sister Therese after his marriage; but the intimacy
between the sisters Therese and Josephine, Countess Deym, had
continued, and the romance, never known to the families of Count
Franz and his sister Countess Teleky, had come down as a tradition
in the family of Count Deym.</p>

<p>The rest of La Mara’s book is filled with the memoirs of
Therese Brunswick, which she began writing in September, 1846,
and called “My Half-Century.” In introducing the interesting
document, La Mara thought herself compelled to abandon Thayer’s
contention that the love-letter had been written in 1806, and substituted
1807 (a date urged also by Ladislaw Jachinecki, in an
article published in the “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Zeitschrift der Internationalen Musikgesellschaft</span>”
for July and August, 1908), on the ground that 1806
had become untenable, 1807 agreed with the almanac and that
Beethoven’s sojourn at Baden in the summer of 1807 did not preclude
a visit to Hungary of three weeks’ duration between the
end of June and July 26. La Mara was persuaded to make the
change by her discovery in the memoirs of the fact that on July 5,
1806, Countess Therese was in Transylvania visiting her sister
Charlotte, Countess Teleky, and was present when the latter
gave birth to a daughter, Blanca, on that date. Having assumed,
with Thayer, that Beethoven wrote the love-letter very soon
after a visit to the Brunswicks at Korompa (which is her reading
of the mysterious “K” in the letter), and sent it from a neighboring
watering-place, convinced that Therese was with her sister on
July 6, 1806, she adopted the theory that the letter was written
in 1807, in which year the much-discussed 6th of July fell on a
Monday. She also alludes to other evidence which she does not
describe but by which she doubtless means a letter by Beethoven to
Breitkopf and Härtel dated “Vienna, July 5, 1806,” which became
known to the investigators when the well-known publishers of
Leipsic made a private publication of the letters from the composer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
found in their archives. This was after the death of Mr. Thayer.
Touching this letter and the significance of Beethoven’s “K” the
writer of this note submits, without argument, a few suggestions:</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">New Suggestions Concerning the Letter</span></div>

<p>1. There is nothing in the letter, beyond what might be
called its atmosphere, to indicate that Beethoven had recently
visited the object of his love. The words “To-day&mdash;yesterday&mdash;what
tearful longings for you,” to which such an interpretation
might be given, plainly refer only to his mood and his thoughts
on the two days when the letter was in his mind; they tell us
nothing about the distance or time which lay between him and
his “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">ferne Geliebte</span>.”</p>

<p>2. It is plain that Beethoven and Prince Esterhazy started
from the same place for the Hungarian watering-place whence the
letter was sent (if it ever was sent), Beethoven travelling by an
unusual route because of a lack of horses, the Prince by the usual
route. It is anything but likely that this place was Martonvásár;
it is much more probable that it was one of Esterhazy’s
country-seats.</p>

<p>3. There is no indication in the letter or anywhere else how
long Beethoven was <i>en route</i>, but the journey extended over
several stages, for “at the stage before the last” he was warned
not to travel at night, etc. He may have been as far in the
interior of Hungary as a post-coach could carry him in, let us say,
two days.</p>

<p>4. We know nothing about the rapidity of travel over Hungarian
roads a century ago, but we do know that as early as 1635,
i. e., 171 years before Beethoven made the journey, an English post
was established which made the trip from London to Edinburgh
and back in six days; and Edinburgh is 357 miles from London
by road. The English mail-coach, therefore travelled an average
of 119 miles in 24 hours. At even half of this speed Beethoven
might have been comparatively near the place in which Countess
Therese spent June and July, 1806.</p>

<p>5. This place was not Korompa, but may have been
Klausenburg or Kolosz, the principal town of Transylvania,
where Count Teleky lived. This is at least remotely possible.</p>

<p>6. It is but natural to assume that the post between the
important places of Hungary and the metropolis of Transylvania
ran fairly often and at fair speed, and if Beethoven expected that
a letter which he thought would be detained at the place where it
was posted till early on Thursday morning would not reach its
destination till Saturday, that destination must have been at a
considerable distance (a two days’ run) from the watering-place.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
“So near, so far!” has little value as evidence; it is an ecstatic
commonplace concerning the unattainable, or that which seems
to be so.</p>

<p>7. The fact that the Countess Therese was not at Korompa
in the early part of July, 1806, is not in itself a sufficient reason for
abandoning that date; she was at Klausenburg. The letter to
Breitkopf and Härtel, though plainly dated “Vienna, July 5, 1806”
(Kalischer, No. 109), might easily be disposed of as convincing
evidence against 1806, if it did not bear the publishers’ endorsement
apparently indicating that it had either been received or answered
on July 11 of the year. Nothing could make Beethoven’s carelessness
in respect of dates plainer than the next letter of Beethoven’s
in which he replied to the letter which Breitkopf and
Härtel had sent him in answer to the proposition which he had
made in the letter dated July 5, 1806. The second letter is dated
“<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Grätz, am 3ten Heu-Monat</span>,” (i.e., Hay month, otherwise July);
yet it refers to the earlier letter and was written at Troppau in
Austrian Silesia, where Beethoven spent the fall of 1806 as the
guest of Prince Lichnowsky. Breitkopf and Härtel’s endorsement
shows that the letter was received and answered in September.
There is some significance, too, in the fact that Beethoven refers
to his journey from Vienna to Troppau, which must have been
nearly 200 miles long, as a short one (“<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Etwas viel zu thun und die
<em>kleine Reise</em> hierher</span>,” etc.). (See Kalischer, Letter No. 110.) Beethoven
may have written the letter in Vienna on one of the first
two days of July, or even the last of June, making one of his
characteristic blunders in the dating, and yet have been deep in
Hungary on the dubious date on which he wrote the love-letter.
The endorsement of Breitkopf and Härtel, “July 5, 1806,” could
not have been anything more than a transcript of the date found
on the letter.</p>

<p>The editor is well aware that his suggestions do not clear up
the mystery; he offers them nevertheless for what they are now
or may hereafter be worth. The references to Beethoven in the
Memoirs of Therese Brunswick made public by La Mara are to
be found in the following excerpts:</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">The Memoirs of Therese von Brunswick</span></div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>During the extraordinary sojourn of 18 days in Vienna my mother
desired that her two daughters, Therese and Josephine, receive Beethoven’s
invaluable instruction in music. Adalbert Rosti, a schoolmate
of my brother’s, assured us that Beethoven would not be persuaded to
accept a mere invitation; but if Her Excellency were willing to climb
the three flights of winding stairs of the house in St. Peter’s Place, and
make him a visit, he would vouch for a successful outcome of the mission.
It was done. Like a schoolgirl, with Beethoven’s Sonatas for Violin and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
Violoncello and Pianoforte under my arm, we entered. The immortal,
dear Louis van Beethoven was very friendly and as polite as he could be.
After a few phrases <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">de part et d’autre</i>, he sat me down at his pianoforte,
which was out of tune, and I began at once to sing the violin and the
’cello parts and played right well. This delighted him so much that he
promised to come every day to the Hotel zum Erzherzog Carl&mdash;then
Goldenen Greifen. It was May in the last year of the last century. He
came regularly, but instead of an hour frequently staid from 12 to 4 or 5
o’clock, and never grew weary of holding down and bending my fingers,
which I had been taught to lift high and hold straight. The noble man
must have been satisfied, for he never missed a single day in the 16....
It was then that the most intimate and cordial friendship was closely
established with Beethoven, a friendship which lasted to the end of his
life. He came to Ofen; he came to Martonvásár; he was initiated into
our social republic of chosen people. A round spot was planted with
high, noble lindens; each tree had the name of a member, and even in
their sorrowful absence we conversed with their symbols, and were entertained
and instructed by them. Often after giving the good-morning
greeting I asked the tree concerning this and the other thing which I
desired to have explained, and it never failed to answer me.</p></div>

<p>Later, speaking of the loss of caste and poverty of her brother-in-law
Count Deym (who had changed his name to Müller because
of a duel fought before he had attained his majority, and conducted
an art museum, and who after his marriage to Therese’s sister
Josephine tried in vain to take the position in society to which his
rank entitled him), the Countess writes:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The aristocracy turned its back on him because he had gone
into business. He could not hunt up his former rich acquaintances.
Beethoven was the faithful visitor at the house of the young Countess&mdash;he
gave her lessons gratis and to be tolerated one had to be a Beethoven.
The numerous relatives, the sisters of her father and their children,
frequently visited their amiable niece. Tableaux were occasionally
given; Deym, being himself an artist, was at home in such matters,
they gave him pleasure.... There were musical soirées. My brother
came in vacation-time and made the acquaintance of Beethoven. The
two musical geniuses became intimately associated with each other,
and my brother never deserted his friend in his frequent financial troubles
until his, alas! too early death.</p>

<p>It was about this time (1814) that Baron C. P. came very often to
Martonvásár. He was fond of my brother and wanted to learn the
science of agriculture from him and his men. We played chess with
each other; he conceived a passion for me and tried to embrace me.
From that moment onward he frequently repeated his offers and waited
two years for my assent&mdash;for I always answered that I should have to
ponder the matter and had had no time to do so. I had remained cold,
an earlier passion had devoured my heart. Josephine needed me, her
children, who were very promising, loved me and I them&mdash;how could I
withdraw myself from such a magic circle? When I was active with
the Women’s Association after the great famine of 1819, we met on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
street. I was in a carriage and had the coachman stop at a signal from
him. He came to the carriage and said significantly, “Have you pondered,
dear Therese? it is the last time I shall ask you. I am going to Dresden
and shall there take a bride unless you make up your mind.” I laughingly
gave him my old answer, heart and head being occupied with the
widespread misery: “I really haven’t had time, dear Carl.” We parted&mdash;he
became my enemy.</p></div>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Recent Investigations in France</span></div>

<p>Shortly after the appearance of La Mara’s essay in 1909, a
singular contribution to the controversy touching the “Immortal
Beloved” came from France. The essay had been reviewed in
the “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Revue des Deux Mondes</span>,” whereupon the editor of “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Le
Temps</span>” asked one of its contributors to make inquiry as to possible
family traditions of the mother of M. F. de Gerando, a grand-niece
of the Countess Therese. This was done, but the lady
would hear nothing of an identification of her grand-aunt with
the object of Beethoven’s passion. Then came journalistic insinuations
that family pride had much to do with the denial. This
provoked M. de Gerando, who undertook, in the “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mercure de
France</span>,” to answer the arguments of Thayer and La Mara. There
was one ludicrous feature in his argument and a new revelation.
He disposed of the kiss sent to Therese by Beethoven through
her brother Count Franz, by saying it was only such a familiarity
as an old man might be permitted to indulge towards a young
pupil; this notwithstanding that Therese was born in 1775 and
Beethoven in 1770 and at the time he wrote the love-letter was still
laboring under the delusion that the year of his birth was 1772.
The revelation consisted in the circumstance, set forth by him,
that among the letters of the Countess Therese he had found a
thick portfolio inscribed “The Journal of my Heart. No Romance,”
which (I quote now from an article contributed by Mr. Philip
Hale to the “New Music Review,” in the numbers for July and
September, 1909)</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>contained many letters, notes, messages written at all hours, and addressed
to a man, whose Christian name was Louis. Mr. de Gerando,
who has been unable to learn the family name of this man, thought at
first, and naturally, that Beethoven was the one; but this Louis, with
whom Therese was passionately in love, to whom she was betrothed,
without the knowledge of others, was a young man of noble family,
much younger than Therese, and had been educated at the Theresianum
in Vienna, a school frequented by young noblemen. “Van Beethoven
was older than the Countess Brunsvik. He was not noble by birth.
He never attended the Theresianum.” The letters reveal a strange
and violent passion. They are at times cold and philosophical. When
Therese signed them with her name, they were true love-letters. When
she signed them with the Greek word “Diotima,” the name of a priestess<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
of beauty and love mentioned by Plato, they were metaphysical speculations,
long-winded discussions on the end of life and the nature of
love. “I do not think that Beethoven would have been contented with
this correspondence of encyclopædists.” There were a few letters from
Louis, one of them sealed with a coat of arms, and thus there is hope
of identification.</p>

<p>One might answer, continues Mr. Hale, that Therese perhaps loved
twice; that there were two Louis in the field. Mr. de Gerando does
not find this probable. Therese was cerebral in her passion. She knew
passion, but her intellectual side revolted at it, and, when her brain
controlled her, she could write phrases like this: “To think that I could
have lowered myself even to the point of marrying him!” (But, one
might reply, the countess might well have said this with reference to
Beethoven, who was beneath her in station.) She rained contempt on
the man who had awakened in her the love that she detested, and when
she had driven him from her mind, she wrote exultantly: “Free! Free!
Free!” Mr. de Gerando argues from this that she would not a second
time have given up her independence, but nothing that a woman like
Therese would have done should surprise even a great-grand-nephew.</p>

<p>Mr. de Gerando does not understand how any love affair between
Therese and Beethoven could have escaped the curious gossips in society,
eager for news and scandal. “The adventure of Therese de Brunsvik
with Louis appears to me to be a sufficient reason to judge the theory
of Thayer inane. At the same time it explains to us the genesis of this
theory. It is now certain, as far as I am concerned, that some resemblance
of the affair between the Countess of Brunsvik and Louis had
come down to Thayer. The similarity of the names, the letter in which
the kiss was sent, and other and more vague indices, led the American
biographer to turn the noble Hungarian dame into the ‘well-beloved’ of
Beethoven.” Such was, in substance, the article of Mr. de Gerando.
It is fair to ask him how the love affair between Therese and the
mysterious Louis, young, noble, etc., escaped the curious gossips, escaped
them so completely that even the great-grand-nephew of Therese is
unable to find out the family name of her lover.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The Year 1802&mdash;The Heiligenstadt Will&mdash;Beethoven’s Views
on Arrangements&mdash;A Defence of Beethoven’s Brothers&mdash;The
Slanders of Romancers and Unscrupulous Biographers&mdash;Compositions
and Publications of the Year.</p></div>


<p>The impatient Beethoven, vexed at the tardy improvement
of his health under the treatment of Vering, made that change
of physicians contemplated in his letter to Wegeler. This was
done some time in the winter 1801-1802, and is all the foundation
there is for Schindler’s story of “a serious illness in the first months
of this year for which he was treated by the highly esteemed physician
Dr. Schmidt.” The remarkable list of compositions and publications
belonging to this year is proof sufficient that he suffered
no physical disability of such a nature as seriously to interrupt
his ordinary vocations; as is also the utter silence of Ries,
Breuning, Czerny, Doležalek and Beethoven himself. The
tone of the letters written at the time is also significant on
this point.</p>

<p>Concerning the failure of his project to follow the example
set in 1800 and give a concert towards the close of the winter in
the theatre we learn all we know from a letter from his brother
Carl to Breitkopf and Härtel dated April 22, 1802. Therein
we read:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>My brother would himself have written to you, but he is ill-disposed
towards everything because the Director of the Theatre, Baron von
Braun, who, as is known, is a stupid and rude fellow, refused him the
use of the Theatre for his concert and gave it to other really mediocre
artists; and I believe it must vex him greatly to see himself so unworthily
treated, particularly as the Baron has no cause and my brother has
dedicated several works to his wife.</p></div>

<p>When one looks down from the Kahlenberg towards Vienna
in the bright, sweet springtime, the interesting country is almost
worthy of Tennyson’s description:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span></p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i28">It lies<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Deep-meadowed, happy, fair with orchard-lawns<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And bowery hollows, crown’d with summer sea.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Conspicuous are the villages, Döbling, hard by the city
Nussdorfer line, and Heiligenstadt, divided from Döbling by
a ridge of higher land in a deep gorge.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Beethoven at Heiligenstadt</span></div>

<p>Dr. Schmidt, having enjoined upon Beethoven to spare his
hearing as much as possible, he removed for the summer to the
place last named. There is much and good reason to believe
that his rooms were in a large peasant house still standing, on
the elevated plain beyond the village on the road to Nussdorf,
now with many neat cottages near, but then probably quite
solitary. In those years, there was from his windows an unbroken
view across fields, the Danube and the Marchfeld, to the Carpathian
mountains that line the horizon. A few minutes’ walk
citywards brought him to the baths of Heiligenstadt; or, in the
opposite direction, to the secluded valley in which at another
period he composed the “Pastoral” symphony. The vast increase
of Vienna and its environs in population, has caused corresponding
changes; but in 1802, that peasant house seems to have offered
him everything he could desire; fresh air, sun, green fields, delightful
walks, bathing, easy access to his physician, and yet a degree
of solitude which now is not easy to conceive as having been
attainable so near the capital.</p>

<p>Part of a letter written hence to Breitkopf and Härtel, but
no longer in the possession of that house, affords another illustration
of Beethoven’s excellent common sense and discrimination
in all that pertained to his art.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>... Concerning arrangements I am heartily glad that you rejected
them. The unnatural rage now prevalent to transplant even <i>pianoforte
pieces</i> to stringed instruments, instruments so utterly opposite to each
other in all respects, ought to come to an end. I insist stoutly that only
Mozart could arrange his pianoforte pieces for other instruments&mdash;and
Haydn&mdash;and, without wishing to put myself in the class of these great
men, I also assert it touching my <i>pianoforte sonatas</i> too, since not only
are whole passages to be omitted and changed, but also&mdash;things are to be
added, and here lies the obstacle, to <i>overcome</i> which one must either be
the master himself or at least have the same <i>skill and inventive power</i>&mdash;I
transcribed a single one of my sonatas for string quartet,<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> yielding to
great persuasion, and I certainly know that it would not be an easy
matter for another to do as well.</p></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span></p>
<p>The difficulties here mentioned, it will be noticed, are those
of transcribing pianoforte music for other instruments; the contrary
operation is so comparatively easy, that Beethoven very
rarely performed it himself, but left it for the most part to young
musicians, whose work he revised and corrected.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>There are a great many pieces by Beethoven (says Ries), published
with the designation: <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Arrangé par l’Auteur même</i>; but only four of
these are genuine, namely: from his famous Septet he arranged first
a violin quintet, and then a Pianoforte Trio; out of his Pianoforte Quintet
(with four wind-instruments) he made a Pianoforte Quartet with three
string-instruments; finally, he arranged the Violin Concerto which is
dedicated to Stephan von Breuning (Op.&nbsp;61) as a Pianoforte Concerto.
Many other pieces were arranged by me, revised by Beethoven, and
then sold as Beethoven’s by his brother Caspar.</p></div>

<p>Without calling in question here the general statement in
this citation, it may be remarked, that if Ries is right in respect
to the arrangement of the Septet as a Quintet, the work remained
in manuscript, for the one published was by Hoffmeister. But
the Trio was begun and, as is believed, finished this year. Its
history has been told. Ries’s statement is neither exhaustive nor
altogether exact touching the arrangements of the Septet. Moreover,
in 1806, without Beethoven’s knowledge or consent, he
arranged the six Quartets, Op.&nbsp;18, and the three Trios for strings,
Op.&nbsp;9, as Pianoforte Trios.</p>

<p>An interesting anecdote from the “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Notizen</span>” may be introduced
here. “Count Browne,” says Ries,</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>made a rather long sojourn about this time in Baden near Vienna, where
I was called upon frequently to play Beethoven’s music evenings in the
presence of enthusiastic Beethovenians, sometimes from notes, sometimes
by heart. Here I had an opportunity to learn how in the majority of
cases a <i>name</i> alone is sufficient to characterize everything in a composition
as beautiful and excellent, or mediocre and bad. One day, weary
of playing without notes, I improvised a march without a thought as to
its merit or any ulterior purpose. An old countess who actually tormented
Beethoven with her devotion, went into ecstasies over it, thinking
it was a new composition of his, which I, in order to make sport of
her and the other enthusiasts, affirmed only too quickly. Unhappily
Beethoven came to Baden the next day. He had scarcely entered
Count Browne’s room in the evening when the old countess began to
speak of the most admirable and glorious march. Imagine my embarrassment!
Knowing well that Beethoven could not tolerate the old
countess, I hurriedly drew him aside and whispered to him that I had
merely meant to make sport of her foolishness. To my good fortune
he accepted the explanation in good part, but my embarrassment grew
when I was called upon to repeat the march, which turned out worse
since Beethoven stood at my side. He was overwhelmed with praise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
on all hands and his genius lauded, he listening in a perturbed manner
and with growing rage until he found relief in a roar of laughter.
Later he remarked to me: “You see, my dear Ries, those are the great
cognoscenti, who wish to judge every composition so correctly and
severely. Only give them the name of their favorite; they will need
nothing more.” Yet the march led to one good result: Count Browne
immediately commissioned Beethoven to compose three Marches for
Pianoforte, four hands.<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a></p></div>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Melancholy Influence of Heiligenstadt</span></div>

<p>The seclusion of Heiligenstadt was of itself so seductive to
Beethoven, that the prudence of Dr. Schmidt in advising him to
withdraw so much from society, may be doubted; the more,
because the benefit to his hearing proved to be small or none.
It gave him too many lonely hours in which to brood over his
calamity; it enabled him still to flatter himself that his secret was
yet safe; it led him to defer, too long for his peace of mind, the
bitter moment of confession; and consequently to deprive himself
needlessly of the tender compassion and ready sympathy of
friends, whose lips were sealed so long as he withheld his confidence.
But, in truth, the secret so jealously guarded was
already known&mdash;but who could inform him of it?&mdash;though not
long nor generally, as we learn from Ries.</p>

<p>It was well for Beethoven, when the time came for him to
return to the city, and to resume the duties and obligations of
his profession. To what depths of despondency he sometimes
sank in those solitary hours at Heiligenstadt, is shown by a remarkable
and most touching paper, written there just before his
return to town, but never seen by other eyes until after his death.
Although addressed to and intended for both his brothers, it is, as
Schindler has remarked, “surprising and singular,” that the name
“Johann” is left utterly blank throughout&mdash;not even being indicated
by the usual.... It is couched in terms of energetic expression,
rising occasionally to eloquence&mdash;somewhat rude and unpolished
indeed, but, perhaps, for that reason the more striking.
The manuscript<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> is so carefully written, and disfigured by so few<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
erasures and corrections, as to prove the great pains taken with
it before the final copy was made. The closing sentences, in
which he discovers his expectations of an early death, have acquired
double importance since the publication of Schindler’s
suicide story, for the decisive manner in which they remove every
possible suspicion that, even in his present hypochondria, he
could contemplate such a crime.</p>

<p>Ries’s paragraph upon Beethoven’s deafness, in which he
relates a circumstance alluded to in the document, is its most
fitting introduction:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>As early as 1802, Beethoven suffered from deafness at various
times, but the affliction each time passed away. The beginning of his
hard hearing was a matter upon which he was so sensitive that one had
to be careful not to make him feel his deficiency by loud speech.
When he failed to understand a thing he generally attributed it to his
absent-mindedness, to which, indeed, he was subject in a great degree.
He lived much in the country, whither I went often to take a lesson from
him. At times, at 8 o’clock in the morning after breakfast he would say:
“Let us first take a short walk.” We went, and frequently did not return
till 3 or 4 o’clock, after having made a meal in some village. On one of
these wanderings Beethoven gave me the first striking proof of his loss
of hearing, concerning which Stephan von Breuning had already spoken
to me. I called his attention to a shepherd who was piping very
agreeably in the woods on a flute made of a twig of elder. For half an
hour Beethoven could hear nothing, and though I assured him that it
was the same with me (which was not the case), he became extremely
quiet and morose. When occasionally he seemed to be merry it was
generally to the extreme of boisterousness; but this happened seldom.</p></div>

in loneliness, when I at times tried to forget all this, O how harshly was
I repulsed by the doubly sad experience of my bad hearing, and yet it
was impossible for me to say to men speak louder, shout, for I am deaf,

ask him in my name to describe my malady and attach this document
to the history of my illness so that so far as is possible at least the world
may become reconciled with me after my death. At the same time I
declare you two to be the heirs to my small fortune (if so it can be called),
divide it fairly, bear with and help each other, what injury you have
done me you know was long ago forgiven. To you brother Carl I give
special thanks for the attachment you have displayed towards me of late.
It is my wish that your lives may be better and freer from care than I
have had, recommend <i>virtue</i> to your children, it alone can give happiness,
not money, I speak from experience, it was virtue that upheld
me in misery, to it next to my art I owe the fact that I did not end my
life by suicide&mdash;Farewell and love each other&mdash;I thank all my friends,
particularly <i>Prince Lichnowsky</i> and <i>Professor Schmid</i>&mdash;I desire that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
instruments from Prince L. be preserved by one of you but let no quarrel
result from this, so soon as they can serve you a better purpose sell
them, how glad will I be if I can still be helpful to you in my grave&mdash;with
joy I hasten towards death&mdash;if it comes before I shall have had
an opportunity to show all my artistic capacities it will still come too
early for me despite my hard fate and I shall probably wish that it had
come later&mdash;but even then I am satisfied, will it not free me from a state
of endless suffering? Come when thou wilt I shall meet thee bravely&mdash;Farewell
and do not wholly forget me when I am dead, I deserve this
of you in having often in life thought of you how to make you happy,
be so&mdash;</p>

<p>Heiglnstadt, October 10th, 1802, thus do I take my
farewell of thee&mdash;and indeed sadly&mdash;yes that beloved hope&mdash;which

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">A Quick Reversion to Merriment</span></div>

<p><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">De profundis clamavit!</i> And yet in that retirement whence
came a paper of such profound sadness was wrought out the
Symphony in D; a work whose grand and imposing introduction&mdash;brilliant
Allegro, a Larghetto “so lovely, so pure and amiably conceived,”
written in the scenes which gave inspiration to the divine
“Pastorale” of which its serene tranquility seems the precursor;
a Scherzo “as merry, wayward, skipping and charming as anything
possible,” as even Oulibichef admits; and a Finale, the very intoxication
of a spirit “intoxicated with fire”&mdash;made it, like the Quartets,
an era both in the life of its author and in the history of instrumental
music. In life, as in music, the more profoundly the depths
of feeling are sounded in the Adagio, the more “merry to the verge
of boisterousness” the Scherzo which follows. But who, reading<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>
that in October that beloved hope had been abandoned and the
high courage which had often inspired him in the beautiful days
of summer had disappeared, could anticipate that in November,
through the wonderful elasticity of his nature, his mind would
have so recovered its tone as to leave no trace visible of the so
recent depression and gloom? Perhaps the mere act of giving
his feelings vent in that extraordinary <i>promemoria</i> may have
brought on the crisis, and from that moment the reaction may
have begun.</p>

<p>The following letter to Zmeskall (to which the recipient
appended the date, November, 1802) is whimsically written on
both sides of a strip of very ordinary coarse writing paper fourteen
and a half inches long by four and three-quarters wide:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>You may, my dear Z., talk as plainly as you please to Walter in
the affair of mine, first because he deserves it and then because since
the belief has gone forth that I am no longer on good terms with Walter
I am pestered by the whole swarm of pianoforte makers wishing to serve
me&mdash;and gratis, moreover, every one wants to build a pianoforte for me
just to my liking; thus Reicha was urgently begged by the man who
made a pianoforte for him to persuade me to let him make me one,
and he is one of the more honest at whose place I have seen good instruments&mdash;make
him understand therefore that I will pay him 30 florins,
whereas I might have one from all the others for nothing, but I will
pay 30 florins only on condition that it be of mahogany and I also want
the one string (<i>una corda</i>) pedal&mdash;if he does not agree to this make it
plain to him that I shall choose one of the others and also introduce
him to Haydn&mdash;a Frenchman, stranger, is coming to me at about 12
o’clock to-day <i>volti</i></p>

<p class="center"><i>subito</i></p>

<p>Herr R(eicha) and I will have the pleasure of <i>displaying my art on a
piano</i> by Jakesch&mdash;<i>ad notam</i>&mdash;if you want also to come we shall have
a good time since afterward we, Reicha, our miserable Imperial Baron
and the Frenchman, will dine together&mdash;you do not need to don a <i>black
coat</i> as we shall be <i>a party of men only</i>.</p></div>

<p>Another letter to Zmeskall (who noted the date November
13, 1802, on it) runs as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Dear Z.&mdash;<i>Give up your music at the Prince’s, nothing else can be done.</i>
We shall rehearse at your house to-morrow morning early at half past 8
and the production will be at my house at eleven&mdash;</p>

<p>“Production” of what? The next Quintet, Op.&nbsp;29, no doubt.
“At my house”&mdash;no longer in the Hamberger House on the Bastion,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>
but in the one pointed out by Czerny: “Beethoven lived a little
later (about 1802) on the Petersplatz, the corner house beside the
Guard-house, <i>vis-à-vis</i> of my present lodgings, in the fourth (?) storey,
where I visited him as often as I did (in the Tiefen Graben). If you
will give me the pleasure of a visit (No. 576) beside Daum, second
storey, I will show you the windows. There I visited several
times every week.”<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a></p>

<p>What whim could have induced Beethoven to remove to
this house with the bells of St. Peter’s on one side and those
of St. Stephen’s sounding down upon him on the other, and he
so suffering with his ears? Perhaps because friends were in the
house. Förster’s earliest recollections of Beethoven date from
this winter and this house; for his father’s dwelling was in the
third storey above him. He remembers that Beethoven volunteered
to instruct him in pianoforte playing, and that he was
forced to rise at six in the morning and descend the cold stairs,
child as he was, hardly six years of age, to take his lessons; and
on one occasion going up again crying because his master had
whipped his little fingers with one of the iron or steel needles
used in knitting the coarse yarn jackets worn by women in service.</p>

<p>The composition of the Marches for Four Hands (Op.&nbsp;45),
ordered by Count Browne, dates also from the house in the
Petersplatz.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>He composed part of the second march while giving me a lesson
on a sonata which I had to play in the evening at the Count’s house
at a little concert&mdash;a thing that still seems incomprehensible to me.
I was also to play the marches on the same occasion with him. While
we were playing young Count P... sitting in the doorway leading to
the next room spoke so loudly and continuously to a pretty woman,
that Beethoven, after several efforts had vainly been made to secure
quiet, suddenly took my hands from the keys in the middle of the music,
jumped up and said very loudly, “I will not play for such swine!” All
efforts to get him to return to the pianoforte were vain, and he would
not even allow me to play the sonata. So the music came to an end
in the midst of much ill humor.</p>

<p>In composing Beethoven tested his pieces at the pianoforte until
he found them to his liking, and sang the while. His voice in singing
was hideous. It was thus that Czerny heard him at work on the four-hand
Marches while waiting in a side room.</p></div>

<p>According to Jahn’s papers this statement came also from
Czerny.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Beethoven and His Brothers</span></div>

<p>It is now necessary to turn back to November and again
undertake the annoying and thankless task of examining a broad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
tissue of mingled fact and misrepresentation and severing the
truth from the error; this time the subject is the relations which
existed between Beethoven and his brothers in these years. A
letter written by Kaspar is the occasion of taking it up here.
Johann André, a music publisher at Offenbach-on-the-Main,
following the example of Hoffmeister, Nägeli, Breitkopf and Härtel
and others, now applied to Beethoven for manuscripts. Kaspar
wrote the reply under date November 23, 1802:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>... At present we have nothing but a Symphony, a grand Concerto for
Pianoforte, the first at 300 florins and the second at the same price, if
you should want three pianoforte sonatas I could furnish them for no
less than 900 florins, all according to Vienna standard, and these you could
not have all at once, but one every five or six weeks, because my brother
does not trouble himself with such trifles any longer and composes
only oratorios, operas, etc.</p>

<p>Also you are to send us eight copies of <i>every</i> piece which you may
possibly engrave. Whether the pieces please you or not I beg you to
answer, otherwise I might be prevented from selling them to someone else.</p>

<p>We have also two Adagios for the Violin with complete instrumental
accompaniment, which will cost 135 florins, and two little easy Sonatas,
each with two movements, which are at your service for 280 florins. In
addition I beg you to present our compliments to our friend Koch.</p>

<p class="sig">
Your obedient,<br />
K. v. Beethoven.<br />
R.I. Treasury official.
</p></div>

<p>This ludicrous display of the young man’s self-importance as
“Royal Imperial Treasury Official” and Ludwig van Beethoven’s
factotum is certainly very absurd; but hardly affords adequate
grounds for the exceeding scorn of Schindler’s remarks upon it.
It is in itself sufficiently provocative of prejudice against its writer.
But a display of vanity and self-esteem is ridiculous, not criminal.</p>

<p>The general charge brought by Ries against Kaspar and
Johann van Beethoven is this:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>His brothers sought in particular to keep all his intimate friends
away from him, and no matter what wrongs they did him, of which he
was convinced, they cost him only a few tears and all was immediately
forgotten. On such occasions he was in the habit of saying: “But they
are my brothers, nevertheless,” and the friend received a rebuke for
his good-nature and frankness. The brothers attained their purpose
in causing the withdrawal from him of many friends, especially when,
because of his hard hearing, it became more difficult to converse with him.</p></div>

<p>Two years after the “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Notizen</span>” left the press Schindler published
his “Biography.” In it, although he first knew Beethoven
in 1814, Johann some years later and Kaspar probably never,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
and therefore personally could know nothing of the facts of this
period, yet he made the picture still darker. The special charge
against Kaspar is that “about this time (in 1800) he began to rule
Beethoven and made him suspicious of his most sincere friends
and devotees by means of false representations and even jealousy.”</p>

<p>There is a class of writers in Germany, whom no regard for
the feelings of the living, no veneration for the memories of the
great dead, no scruples on the score of truth, and even, in some
cases, not respect and admiration for the greatest living genius,
talent, and literary or scientific fame, restrain from using, or
moderate their use of, whatever can add piquancy to their appeals
to the prurient imaginations of certain classes of readers. Delicacy
of feeling and nicety of conscience are not to be expected of such
heartless traducers of the living and the dead; but that even the
most contemptible of the tribe, regardless of the pain which such
a slander of her husband’s father must have caused to a widowed
mother and her amiable children, could venture to represent
Karl Kaspar van Beethoven as the seller of his wife’s virtue and
a sharer in the wages of her shame, is as inconceivable, as that
his book should be received with praise by critics and applause
by the public; that it should gain its author pecuniary profit
instead of a prison. The story is utterly without foundation; a
pure invention and a falsehood, and is told, moreover, of poor
Kaspar, at a time when as yet he had no wife! Unfortunately,
this treatment of Beethoven’s brothers is not confined to writers
of novels and feuilletonists. They, who profess to write history,
no sooner strike upon this topic, than fancy seems to usurp the
seat of reason and imagination to take the place of judgment.
The lines of Ries expand into paragraphs; the sentences of
Schindler into chapters. But the picture, thus overdrawn and
exaggerated, in some degree corrects itself; for if the brothers
were really as represented, what is to be thought of Beethoven
if he in fact was so led, controlled and held in subjection by them
as described?</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Characters of Karl Kaspar and Johann</span></div>

<p>Now, what is really known of Karl Kaspar and Johann,
though it sufficiently confutes much of the calumnious nonsense
which has been printed about them, is not fitted to convey any
very exalted idea of their characters. The same Frau Karth,
who remembered Ludwig in his youth as always “gentle and
lovable,” related that Kaspar was less kindly in his disposition,
“proud and presumptuous,” and that Johann “was a bit stupid,
yet very good-natured.” And such they were in manhood. Kaspar,
like Ludwig, was very passionate, but more violent in his sudden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>
wrath; Johann, slow to wrath and placable. Notwithstanding the
poverty of his youth and early manhood, it is not known that
Kaspar was avaricious; but Johann had felt too bitterly the misery
of want and dependence, and became penurious. After he had
accumulated a moderate fortune, the contests between his avarice
and the desire to display his wealth led to very ludicrous exhibitions.
In a word, Beethoven was not a phenomenon of goodness, nor were
his brothers monsters of iniquity. That both Ries and Schindler
wrote honestly has not been doubted; but common justice
demands the reminder that they wrote under the bias of
strong personal dislike to one or both brothers. Ries wrote impressions
received at a very early time of life, and records opinions
formed upon incomplete data. Schindler wrote entirely upon
hearsay. Ries had not completed his twenty-first year when he
departed from Vienna (1805). Howsoever strong were Beethoven’s
gratitude to Franz Ries and affection for Ferdinand, fourteen
years was too great a disparity in age to allow that trustful and
familiar intercourse between master and pupil which could enable
the latter to speak with full knowledge; nor does a man of
Beethoven’s age and position turn from old and valued friends,
like the Lichnowskys, Breuning, Zmeskall and others of whatever
names, to make a youth of from 18 to 20 years, a new-comer and
previously a stranger, even though a favorite pupil, his confidential
adviser. Facts confirm the proposition in this case. We know
that Beethoven in 1801 imparted grave matters to Wegeler and
Amenda, of which Ries a year later had only received intimation
from Breuning; and other circumstances of which he knew nothing
are recorded in the testament of 1802. The charges against
the brothers, both of Ries and Schindler, are general in terms;
Ries only giving specifications or instances in proof. Schindler
may be passed by as but repeating the “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Notizen</span>.” Now, the
onus of Ries’s charges is this:</p>

<p>First: that Kaspar thrust himself impertinently into his
brother’s business; second: that both brothers intrigued to isolate
Beethoven from his intimate friends and that their machinations
were in many cases successful.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Karl Kaspar as a Business Manager</span></div>

<p>To the first point it is to be remarked: Besides Beethoven’s
often expressed disinclination to engage personally in negotiations
for the sale of his works&mdash;although when he did he showed no
lack of a keen eye to profits&mdash;his physical and mental condition
at this period of his life often rendered the assistance of an agent
indispensable. Accounts were to be kept with half a dozen publishers;
letters received upon business were numerous and often<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>
demanded prompt replies; proof-sheets were constantly arriving
for revision and correction; copyists required supervision; an
abundance of minor matters continually coming up and needing
attention when Beethoven might be on his long rambles over
hill and dale, the last man to be found in an emergency. One
asks with astonishment, how could so obvious a necessity for a
confidential agent have escaped notice? Who should or could
this agent be but his brother Kaspar?<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> He held an honorable
place in a public office, the duties of which necessarily implied
the possession of those talents for, and habits of, prompt and
skillful performance of business which his early receipt of salary
and his regular advancement in position show that he really did
possess; his duties detained him in the city at all times, occasional
short vacations excepted, and yet left him ample leisure to attend
to his brother’s affairs; he was a musician by education and fully
competent to render valuable service in that “fearful period of
arrangements”&mdash;as it is well known he did. What would have
justly been said of Beethoven if he had passed by one so eminently
qualified for the task&mdash;one on whom the paternal relation and
his own long continued care and protection had given him so
many claims&mdash;and had transferred the burden from his own
shoulders to those of other friends? But if, after adequate trial,
the agent proved unsatisfactory, the case would be changed and
the principal might with propriety seek needed assistance in other
quarters. And precisely this appears to have occurred; for after
a few years Kaspar disappears almost entirely from our history
in connection with his brother’s pecuniary affairs. This fact is
stronger evidence than anything in Ries’s statements, that Beethoven
became dissatisfied with his brother’s management, and
would have still more weight had he been less fickle, inconstant
and undecided in matters of business.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a></p>

<p>Seyfried, whose acquaintance with Beethoven ripened just at
this time into intimacy, and who in 1802-’05 had the best possible
opportunities for observation, beheld the relations between the
brothers with far less jaundiced eyes than Ries. He says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Beethoven was the more glad to choose joyous Vienna for his
future and permanent home since two younger brothers had followed
him thither, who took off his shoulders the oppressive load of financial
cares and who were compelled to act almost as guardians for the priest
of art to whom the ordinary affairs of civil life were as strange as strange
could be.</p></div>

<p>At that time Seyfried, like Ries, was ignorant of the circumstances
detailed to Wegeler and Amenda and in the testament;
but the admirable selection of words in the closing phrase will
strike all who have had occasion to read Beethoven’s countless
notes asking advice or aid in matters which most men would
deem too trivial for even a passing word in conversation. The
specifications of Ries in his charges against Kaspar will not
long detain us. The story of the quarrel over the disposition
of the Nägeli Sonatas may stand in all its ugliness and with no
comment save the suggestion of the possibility that Kaspar’s
word as Ludwig’s agent may have been pledged to the Leipsic
publisher. The one really specific charge of Ries is the one on
page 124 of the “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Notizen</span>”:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>All trifles, and many things which he did not want to publish because
he thought them unworthy of his name, were secretly given to
publicity by his brother. Thus songs which he had composed years
before his departure for Vienna, became known only after he had
reached a high degree of fame. Thus, too, little compositions which
he had written in autograph albums were filched and published.</p></div>

<p>By “trifles” Ries, of course, here refers to the “Bagatelles,
Op.&nbsp;33, par Louis van Beethoven, 1782,” as the manuscript is
superscribed, published in the spring of 1803. The manuscript
itself proves Ries to be in error. The words “par Louis van<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span>
Beethoven” are in a hand unlike anything known to the present
writer from Beethoven’s pen. This fact, together with a something
not easily described in the appearance of the notes, suggests the idea
that this copy of the “Bagatelles” was made by Kaspar, and compiled,
except No. 6 and perhaps one other, from the compositions of
Beethoven in his boyhood. But the corrections&mdash;the words <i>Andante
gracioso</i>, <i>Scherzo Allegro</i>, <i>Allegretto con una certa espressione parlante</i>,
etc., written with lead pencil or a different ink, are certainly from
Beethoven’s own hand; also, in still another ink, the thoroughly
Beethovenish “Op.&nbsp;33.” No one can mistake that. This work
most assuredly was never “secretly given to the public.”<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a></p>

<p>The only Album composition known to have been published
in those years is the song with variations, “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Ich denke dein</span>”;
and this Beethoven himself had offered to Hoffmeister before it
was printed by the <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Kunst- und Industrie-Comptoir</span>.</p>

<p>The “songs” referred to by Ries can only be those of Op.&nbsp;52.
The original manuscript, having disappeared, neither refutes nor
confirms his opinion. It is, however, exceedingly doubtful that
Beethoven’s brothers would have dared give an opus number
to a stolen publication. <i>A priori</i> Ries is more likely to be in
error here than in regard to the “Bagatelles.” Now, the only
contemporary criticism upon the latter which has been discovered,
is a single line in Moll’s “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Annalen der Literatur</span>” (Vienna, 1804):
“Deserve the title in every sense of the word.” Upon the “Song
with Variations” no notice whatever has been found. But, Opus
52 was received by the “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Allgemeine Musik-Zeitung</span>” of August
28, 1805, in this style; <i>Opera</i> 47 and 38 having been duly praised,
the writer continues:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Is it possible that No. 3 of these eight songs is from the pen of this
composer, admirable even in his vagaries? It must be, since it is. At
least his name is printed large on the title-page, the publisher is mentioned,
the songs were published in Vienna where the composer lives, and, indeed,
bear his latest <i>opus</i> number. Comprehend it he who can&mdash;that
a thing in all respects so commonplace, poor, weak and in great part
ludicrous should not only emanate from such a man but even be published.</p></div>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Karl Kaspar a Probable Scapegoat</span></div>

<p>And more like this, illustrated by copying “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Das Blümchen
Wunderhold</span>.” These citations suggest an obvious explanation of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>
Ries’s mistake, namely: Beethoven, mortified, ashamed, angry, purposely
left him to believe that he was innocent of the publication
of these compositions. It was one of the advantages of having
Kaspar in Vienna, that the responsibility of such false steps
could be shifted upon him. Those who are predetermined not
to admit in Beethoven’s character any of the faults, frailties and
shortcomings of our common human nature, will of course censure
this explanation. Let them propose a better.<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> Finally: In the
paragraph upon the efforts of Beethoven’s brothers to keep all
of the composer’s friends away from him it is easy to read between
the lines that it was Ries himself who oft “was rebuked for his
good-nature and frankness,” which of itself to some extent lessens
the force of the charge. But it is best met by the first half of
the Will, or testament, which, with the confessions to Wegeler
and Amenda, as above said, open to our knowledge an inner life
of the writer studiously concealed from his protégé.</p>

<p>In this solemn document, written as he supposed upon the
brink of the grave, Beethoven touches upon this very question.
We learn from his own affecting words, that the cause of his
separation from friends lay, <i>not</i> in the machinations of his brothers,
but in his own sensitiveness. He records for future use, what he
cannot now explain without disclosing his jealously guarded
secret. That record now serves a double purpose; it relieves
Kaspar and Johann from a portion of the odium so long cast
upon their memories; and proves Ries to be, in part at least, in
error, without impugning his veracity. It is very probable Ries
never saw the will. Had he known and carefully read it, the
prejudices of his youth must have been weakened, the opinions
founded upon partial knowledge modified. He was of too noble
a nature not to have gladly seen the memories of the dead vindicated&mdash;not
to have been struck with and affected by the words
of his deceased master: “To you, brother Carl, I give special
thanks for the attachment you have displayed towards me of
late.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Pass we to another topic.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>On frequent occasions (says Ries), he showed a truly paternal
interest in me. From this source there sprang the written order (in 1802),
which he sent me in a fit of anger because of an unpleasant predicament
into which Carl van Beethoven had gotten me. Beethoven wrote:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span>
“You do not need to come to Heiligenstadt; I have no time to lose.”
At the time Count Browne was indulging himself with pleasures in
which I was taking part, he being kindly disposed towards me, and was
in consequence neglecting my lessons.</p></div>

<p>That Beethoven, during the summer when his vocations were
interrupted by the dark hours in which the “will” was produced,
could have no time to lose in those lighter days when the spirit
of labor was upon him is clear from the surprising list of compositions
written and published in this year.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Compositions Completed in 1802</span></div>

<p>The works which were developed were the three Violin
Sonatas, Op.&nbsp;30; the first two of the three Pianoforte Sonatas, Op.
31; the two sets of Variations, Op.&nbsp;34 and 35; the “Bagatelles,”
Op.&nbsp;33, and (the chief work of the year) the second Symphony,
D major, Op.&nbsp;36. The works which came from the press were the
Pianoforte Sonatas, Op.&nbsp;22, 26 and 27, Nos. 1 and 2; the Serenade,
Op.&nbsp;25; the Septet, Op.&nbsp;20; the Quintet, Op.&nbsp;29; the Rondo in G,
Op.&nbsp;51, No. 2; the transcription for strings of the Pianoforte
Sonata in E, Op.&nbsp;14, No. 1; the Variations for Violoncello and
Pianoforte on “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Bei Männern welche Liebe fühlen</span>,” dedicated to
Count Browne; the six Contradances and six Rustic (“<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Ländrische</span>”)
Dances. There were thirteen performances of the ballet
“Prometheus.” Moreover, it is at least remotely possible that
the two large works which were played together with the Symphonies
in C and D at Beethoven’s concert on April 5, 1803&mdash;viz.: the
Pianoforte Concerto in C minor, Op.&nbsp;37 and the Oratorio “Christus
am Ölberg,” Op.&nbsp;85&mdash;were not so far advanced in all their parts
that they, too, may have occupied the attention of Beethoven in
the winter of 1802-03.</p>

<p>For nearly all the works completed in 1802, studies are to be
found in the sketchbook described in full by Nottebohm,<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a> which
covers the period from the fall of 1801 to the spring of 1802;
like the majority of the sketchbooks, it contains themes and studies
which were never worked out. “Overlooking the sketches which
cross each other,” says Nottebohm, “and putting aside all that is
immaterial, the compositions represented in the book which were
completed and are known, may be set down chronologically as
follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
“<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Opferlied</span>,” by Mathisson, first form.<br />
Scene and Aria for Soprano: “No&mdash;non turbarti.”<br />
Three of the Contradances.<br />
Bagatelle for Pianoforte, No. 6 of Op.&nbsp;33.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>Last movement of the Symphony in D major.<br />

Last movement of the Sonata for Pianoforte and Violin in A major, Op.&nbsp;47.<br />

Variations for Pianoforte in F major, Op.&nbsp;34 (only the first hints).<br />
Sonata for Pianoforte in G major, Op.&nbsp;31, No. 1 (not complete).”
</div>

<p>To which may be added as occurring early in the book, the
theme of the Larghetto of the Symphony in D (here for horns),
out of which eventually grew the Trio in the Scherzo. A curious
remark on one of the pages seems to be a memorandum for a
piece of descriptive music: “Marital felicity, dark clouds upon the
brow of the husband in which the fairer half unites but still seeks
to dispel.”</p>

<p>The evident care taken by the composer at this period to
make the opus numbers really correspond to the chronological
order of his works, is a strong reason for concluding that the
Violin Sonatas, Op.&nbsp;30, were completed or nearly so before he
removed to Heiligenstadt. Even in that case, what wonderful
genius and capacity for labor does it show, that, before the close
of the year, in spite of ill health and periods of the deepest despondency,
and of all the interruptions caused by his ordinary vocations
after his return to town, he had completed the first two Sonatas of
Op.&nbsp;31, the two extensive and novel sets of Variations, Op.&nbsp;34 and
Op.&nbsp;35, and the noble Second Symphony!&mdash;all of them witnesses
that he had really “entered upon a new path,” neither of
them more so than the Symphony so amazingly superior to its
predecessor in grandeur and originality. This was, in fact, the
grand labor of this summer.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">The Pianoforte Sonatas, Op.&nbsp;31</span></div>

<p>The three Sonatas for Pianoforte and Violin are dedicated
to Czar Alexander I of Russia, who is said to have given
command that a valuable diamond ring be sent to the composer.
Lenz could find no record of such an incident in the imperial
archives. The sketches show that the movement which now
concludes the “Kreutzer” Sonata (Op.&nbsp;47) was originally designed
for the first of the three, the one in A major; and that for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>
Adagio of the second, in C minor, Beethoven, assuming that he
already associated the theme with the work, first contemplated
using the key of G.</p>

<p>The three Sonatas for Pianoforte, Op.&nbsp;31, are without dedication.
W. Nagel connects them, or one of them, with the following
extraordinary letter to Hoffmeister:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="dateline">
Vienna, April 8, 1802.
</p>

<p>Are you all ridden by the devil gentlemen that you propose <i>such
a sonata</i> to me?</p>

<p>At the time of the revolutionary fever&mdash;well&mdash;such a thing might
have been very well; but now&mdash;when everything is trying to get back
into the old rut, Buonaparte has signed the concordat with the Pope&mdash;such
a sonata?</p>

<p>If it were a <i>Missa pro sancta Maria a tre voci</i>, or a Vesper, etc.&mdash;I
would take my brush in hand at once&mdash;and write down a <i>Credo in unum
Deum</i> in big pound notes&mdash;but good God, such a sonata&mdash;for these days
of newly dawning Christianity&mdash;hoho!&mdash;leave me out of it, nothing will
come of it.</p>

<p>Now my answer in quickest tempo&mdash;the lady can have a sonata
from me, and I will follow her plan in respect of æsthetics in a general
way&mdash;and without following the keys&mdash;price 5 ducats&mdash;for which she may
keep it for her own enjoyment for a year, neither I nor <i>she</i> to publish it.</p>

<p>At the expiration of the year&mdash;the sonata will be mine to&mdash;i. e.,
I shall publish it, and she shall have the privilege&mdash;if she thinks it will
be an honor&mdash;to ask me to dedicate it to her....</p>

<p>Now God keep you gentlemen.</p>

<p>My Sonata is beautifully printed [<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">gestochen</i>, i. e., engraved]&mdash;but
it took you a pretty time&mdash;send my Septet into the world a little quicker&mdash;for
the crowd is waiting for it&mdash;and you know the Empress has it and
there are (scamps) in the imperial city as well as the (imperial court)
I can vouch for nothing&mdash;therefore make haste.</p>

<p>Herr (Mollo) has again recently published my Quartets but full
of faults and <i>Errata</i>&mdash;in large as well as small form, they swarm in them
like fish in the sea, there is no end of them&mdash;<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">questo è un piacere per un autore</i>&mdash;that’s
pricking music with a vengeance, in truth my skin is full of
prickings and rips because of this beautiful edition of my Quartets....</p>

<p>Now farewell and remember me as I do you. Till death your

<p class="sig">
L. v. Beethoven.
</p></div>

<p>An engagement which Beethoven had obtained from Count
Browne for Ries was one that gave him leisure to pursue his
studies, and he often came to Vienna and Heiligenstadt for that
purpose. Thus it happens that the “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Notizen</span>” also contribute
to the history of these Sonatas. Ries writes:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Beethoven had promised the three solo sonatas (Op.&nbsp;31) to Nägeli
in Zurich while his brother Carl (Caspar) who, unfortunately, was always
meddling with his affairs, wanted to sell them to a Leipsic publisher.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span>
There were frequent exchanges of words between the brothers on this
account because Beethoven having given his word wanted to keep it. When
the sonatas (the first two) were about to be sent away Beethoven was living
in Heiligenstadt. During a promenade new quarrels arose between the
brothers and finally they came to blows. The next day he gave me
the sonatas to send straight to Zurich, and a letter to his brother
enclosed in another to Stephan von Breuning who was to read it. A
prettier lesson could scarcely have been read by anybody with a good
heart than Beethoven read his brother on the subject of his conduct
on the day before. He first pointed it out in its true and contemptible
character, then he forgave him everything, but predicted a bad future
for him unless he mended his ways. The letter, too, which he had written
to Breuning was very beautiful.</p></div>

<p>The first two Sonatas (G major and D minor) appeared in
the spring of 1803, as Op.&nbsp;29, in Nägeli’s “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Répertoire des Clavecinistes</span>”
as <i>Cahier 5</i> (the third followed soon after as Op.&nbsp;33, together
with the “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Sonate pathétique</span>” as <i>Cahier 11</i>). Of <i>Cahier 5</i> Nägeli
sent proof-sheets. Ries reports on the subject as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>When the proof-sheets came I found Beethoven writing. “Play
the Sonata through,” he said to me, remaining seated at his writing-desk.
There was an unusual number of errors in the proofs, which fact already
made Beethoven impatient. At the end of the first <i>Allegro</i> in the Sonata
in G major, however, Nägeli had introduced four measures&mdash;after the
fourth measure of the last hold:</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/zill_t367.png" width="300" height="108" alt="added measures" />
</div>

<p>When I played this Beethoven jumped up in a rage, came running
to me, half pushed me away from the pianoforte, shouting: “Where the
devil do you find that?” One can scarcely imagine his amazement and
rage when he saw the printed notes. I received the commission to make
a record of all the errors and at once send the sonatas to Simrock in
Bonn, who was to make a reprint and call it <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Édition très correcte</i>. In
this place belong three notes to me:</p>

<p>1. “Be good enough to make a note of the errors and send a
record of them at once to Simrock, with the request that he publish as
soon as possible&mdash;day after to-morrow I will send him the sonata and
concerto.”</p>

<p>2. “I must beg you again to do the disagreeable work of making a
clear copy of the errors in the Zurich sonatas and sending it to Simrock;
you will find a list of the errors at my house in the Wieden.”</p>

<p>3. “Dear Ries!
</p>

<p>“Not only are the expression marks poorly indicated but there are
also false notes in several places&mdash;therefore be careful!&mdash;or the work
will again be in vain. <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Ch’à detto l’amato bene?</i>”</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span></p>

<p>The closing words of the second note show that the matter
was not brought to an end until late in the spring of 1803, after
Beethoven had removed into the theatre buildings An-der-Wien.
After the Sonatas became known in Vienna Doležalek asked
Beethoven if a certain passage in the D minor Sonata was correct.
“Certainly it is correct,” replied the composer, “but you are a
countryman of Krumpholz&mdash;nothing will go into that hard
Bohemian head of yours.”</p>

<p>A circumstance related by Czerny, if accepted as authoritative,
proves that two of the three Sonatas were completed in the country.
Once when he (Beethoven) saw a rider gallop past his windows
in his summer sojourn in Heiligenstadt near Vienna, the regular
beat (of the horse’s hoofs) gave him the idea for the theme of
the Finale of the D minor sonata, Op.&nbsp;31, No. 2:</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/zill_t368.png" width="300" height="68" alt="D minor sonata theme" />
</div>

<p>The six Variations in F on an Original Theme, Op.&nbsp;34, dedicated
to the Princess Odescalchi, were probably composed immediately
after the Variations in E-flat, Op.&nbsp;35. In the midst of the sketches
for the latter (in the Kessler sketchbook) two measures of the
theme are noted and the remark appended, “Each variation in a
different key&mdash;but alternately passages now in the left hand and
then almost the same or different ones in the right.” The two
sets of Variations and the Quintet, Op.&nbsp;29, were sold to Breitkopf
and Härtel in October, 1802. In a letter which the publishers
received from the composer on October 18, 1802, Beethoven
writes:</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Characteristics of the Variations</span></div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I have made two sets of Variations of which the first may be said
to number 8, the second 30; both are written in <i>a really entirely new style</i>
and each in quite a different way. I should very much like to have
them published by you, but under the one condition that the honorarium
be about 50 florins for the two sets&mdash;do not let me make this offer in vain,
for I assure you you will never regret the two works. Each theme in
them is treated independently and in a wholly different manner. As
a rule I only hear of it through others when I have new ideas, since I
never know it myself; but this time I can assure you myself that the
style in both works is new to me.</p></div>

<p>A more interesting letter received by Breitkopf and Härtel
on December 26, 1802, relates to the same subject. It demands
insertion in full:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Instead of the noise about a new method of V(ariations) such as
would be made by our neighbors the Gallo-Franks, like, for instance,
a certain Fr. composer who presents fugues <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">après une nouvelle Méthode</i>,
it consisting in this that the fugue is no fugue, etc.&mdash;I nevertheless want
to call attention to the fact that these V. differ at least from others,
and this I thought I could do in the most unconstrained and least conspicuous
manner by means of the little prefatory note which I beg of
you to print in the small as well as the large V., leaving it for you to say
in what language or how many languages, since we poor Germans are
compelled to speak in all tongues.</p>

<p>Here is the prefatory note:</p>

<p>Inasmuch as these V. differ materially from my earlier ones I have,
instead of designating them merely by number, 1, 2, 3, etc., included
them in the list of my <i>greater musical works</i>, and this also for the further
reason that the themes are original.</p>

<p class="sig">
The author.
</p>

<p>N.B. If you find it necessary to change or improve anything you have
my entire permission.</p></div>

<p>That by the “large variations,” whose number (30) Breitkopf
and Härtel seem to have called in question, Beethoven meant
his Op.&nbsp;35, is made plain by a third letter running as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="dateline">
Vienna, April 8, 1803.
</p>

<p>I have wanted to write to you for a long time, but my business affairs
are so many that they permit but little correspondence. You seem to
be mistaken in your opinion that there are not as many variations (as
I stated) only it would not do to announce the number as there is no
way of telling how in the large set three variations are run into each
other in the Adagio, and the Fugue can certainly not be called a variation,
nor the Introduction, which, as you may see for yourself, begins with
the bass of the theme, then expands to 2, 3 and finally 4 parts, when the
theme at last makes its appearance, which again cannot be called a variation,
etc.&mdash;but if this is not clear to you, send me a proof-sheet along with
the manuscript as soon as a copy is printed, so that I may be guarded
against confusion&mdash;you would do me a great favor if you would omit from
the large variations the dedication to abbé Stadler and print the following,
viz.: <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">dediées etc. À Monsieur le Comte Maurice Lichnowsky</i>; he is a
brother of Prince Lichnowsky and only recently did me an unexpected
favor, and I have no other opportunity to return the kindness, if you
have already engraved the dedication to abbé Stadler I will gladly pay
the cost of changing the title-page, do not hesitate, write what the expense
will be and I will pay it with pleasure, I earnestly beg you to do this
if you have not sent out any copies&mdash;in the case of the small variations
the dedication to Princess Odescalchi remains.</p>

<p>I thank you very much for the beautiful things of Sebastian Bach’s,
I will preserve and study them&mdash;should there be a continuation of the
pieces send them to me also&mdash;if you have a good text for a cantata or
other vocal piece send it to me.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span></p>

<p>In spite of Beethoven’s warning, Op.&nbsp;34 was printed without
the proof having been read by him; this provoked another letter
calling attention to a large number of errors in the publication,
of which Beethoven promised to send a list. He also expressed
a fear that the “large variations” would also be faulty, the more
since his own manuscript had been put into the hands of the
engraver, and asked that the fact that the theme was from his
ballet “Prometheus” be indicated on the title-page, if there were
still time, offering, as in the case of the dedication, to pay the cost
of the change. Again he begged to be permitted to correct a
proof copy&mdash;a request which was ignored in this instance, as it
had been in the first. The result was a somewhat gentle protest
in another letter (October, 1803), in which Beethoven offered the
firm the Variations on “God save the King” and “Rule Britannia,”
the song “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Wachtelschlag</span>” and three Marches for the Pianoforte,
four hands. The conclusion of the letter, with its postscript, has
a double value&mdash;as an exhibition of Beethoven’s attitude towards
the criticism of his day and as a contribution to the debated
question touching the illicit printing of some of his early compositions.
We quote:</p>

am so infamously treated, which is I suppose an evidence of impartiality&mdash;for
aught I care&mdash;so long as this makes for the fortune of the M.Z.&mdash;what

<p>It was through the printing of the letters to Breitkopf and
Härtel that the fact became known that Beethoven originally had
intended to dedicate the Variations in E-flat to Abbé Stadler.
The Rondo in G, which was announced by Hoffmeister and Kühnel
on March 19, 1803, was published in connection with the Rondo in
C which had already appeared in 1798, as Op.&nbsp;51, Nos. 1 and 2. It
was originally dedicated to Countess Guicciardi, but Beethoven
gave her the Sonata in C-sharp minor in exchange for it and inscribed
the Rondo to Countess Henriette Lichnowsky. This would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>
seem to indicate that it was finished before the Sonata, probably in
1801. Nottebohm has proved in his study of the Kessler sketchbook
that the sixth of the “Bagatelles,” in D major, had its origin
in 1802, when Beethoven was at work on the second Symphony.<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a></p>

difficult to see in it the representation of a consumptive woman only 40 years old. Moreover,
it is strange that Beethoven should have sent from Vienna for the portrait of his
grandfather and not for that of his dearly loved mother had one been in existence. It
is only because of a resemblance between this picture and another that the belief exists
that portraits of both of the parents of Beethoven are in existence. In 1890 two oil
portraits were found in a shed in Cologne and restored by the painter Kempen, who
recognized in them the handiwork of the painter Beckenkamp, who, like Beethoven’s
mother, was born in Ehrenbreitstein, was a visitor at the Beethoven home in Bonn and
died in Cologne in 1828. The female portrait agrees with that in Bonn; they are life-size,
finely executed pictures, but they are certainly not Beethoven’s parents. Enough
has been said about the portrait of the mother. In the case of that of the father the
first objection is that it also lacks authentication. Fischer’s description does not wholly
fit the picture; the old man would not have forgotten the protruding lower lip. But
the entire expression of the face, serious, it is true, but fleshy and vulgar, and the gray
perruque, do not conform to what we know of the easy-going musician. It will be difficult,
too, to trace any resemblance of expression between it and the familiar one of
Beethoven from which a conclusion might be drawn. So long as proofs are wanting,
scientific biography will have no right to accept the portraits as those of Beethoven’s
parents. Reproductions of them may be found in the “Musical Times” of London,
December 15, 1892.</p></div>

1823: “To-day is the 15th of December, the day of your birth, but I am not sure whether
it is the 15th or 17th, inasmuch as we can not depend on the certificate of baptism
and I read it only once when I was still with you in January.” The nephew, it will be
observed, does not appeal to a family tradition but to the baptismal certificate and the
uncertainty, therefore, is with reference to the date of baptism, not of birth. Hence the
deduction which Kalischer makes (“<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Vossische Zeitung</span>,” No. 17, 1891) that Beethoven
was born on December 15. Hesse calls to witness a clerk employed in Simrock’s establishment
with whom Beethoven had business transactions, and who had written on the
back of the announcement of Beethoven’s death, “L. v. Beethoven was born on December
16, 1770.”</p></div>

slight modification, at least so far as his childhood is concerned, without violence to the
verities of history. Fischer would have us believe that the lad took part with his brother
Carl in boyish capers which were not always of a harmless character. In a letter to
Simrock, Court Councillor Krupp relates: “My father, who died in 1847, was a youthful
friend and schoolmate of Ludwig and Carl van Beethoven, and distantly related to the
godmother of the former. Thursdays were holidays for the schoolboys, and the brothers
Beethoven, L. and C., were then wont to come to the house of my grandparents, No. 28
Bonngasse (now belonging to my sister and me), and amuse themselves, among other
things, with target shooting. There was a wall between the garden of our house and the
gardens of the adjoining houses in the Wenzelgasse against which the target was placed
at which the boys shot arrows; a hit in the centre brought forth a <i>Stüber</i> (about 4 pfennigs)
for the lucky marksman. Garden and wall are now (1890) in the same condition
as then. In the evening the Beethoven brothers went home through the Gudenauergässchen.
The family lived at the time in the Wenzelgasse back of our house.” Here
is an inaccuracy, for Ludwig van Beethoven no longer went to school when the Beethoven
family changed their house in the Rheingasse for that in the Wenzelgasse&mdash;which was
probably about 1785. The letter continues: “Ludwig’s father treated him harshly,
especially when he was intoxicated, and sometimes shut him up in the cellar.”</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_21_21" id="Footnote_21_21"></a><a href="#FNanchor_21_21"><span class="label">[21]</span></a> There seems to have been no knowledge on the part of Beethoven’s biographers
of this visit to Holland until Thayer brought the incident to notice. It is, therefore,
highly significant that the Fischer family also recalled the circumstance and, besides,
knew what brought it about. The sister of young Rovantini, who died in September,
1781, was employed as governess in Rotterdam, and on receiving intelligence of the
death of her brother came to Bonn, together with her mistress (whose name has not
been preserved), to visit his grave. For a month she was an inmate of the Beethoven
house; there was a good deal of music-making and some excursions to neighboring places
of interest, including Coblenz. The visitors invited the Beethoven family to make a
trip to Holland. Inasmuch as Johann van Beethoven could not get away, the mother
went with the lad, and, a party of five, they embarked upon the voyage. This must have
been in October or November, 1781, which agrees with the story of the extreme cold
encountered on the voyage. They remained a considerable time, but whether or not
Ludwig gave a concert as he had intended, is not known. Despite the attentions
showered upon him by the wealthy lady from Rotterdam and the many honors, the
pecuniary results were disappointing. To Fischer’s question how he had fared Beethoven
is reported to have answered: “The Dutch are skinflints (<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Pfennigfuchser</i>); I’ll never
go to Holland again.”</p></div>

the variations are dedicated, was the wife of Count Ignaz von Wolff-Metternich, “Konferenzmeister”
and president of the High Court of Appeals, who died in Bonn, March
15, 1790. Ernst Christoph Dressler, composer of the theme varied by Beethoven, was
an opera singer in Cassel.</p></div>

encouraging words, but at the last had to make her escape with the others into the Giergasse
over boards and down ladders. Admitting that there are many inaccuracies in
the recital, Dr. Deiters nevertheless accepts it in this particular and conjectures that
Beethoven lived in the house in the Rheingasse until 1785.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_38_38" id="Footnote_38_38"></a><a href="#FNanchor_38_38"><span class="label">[38]</span></a> Thayer’s correction of Dr. Wegeler’s account of Beethoven’s first acquaintance
with the family von Breuning was sharply criticized by a grandson of Wegeler in an
article published in the <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Coblenzer Zeitung</i> of May 20, 1890. Thayer preserved Karl
Wegeler’s article in the library copy of his biography, and had he lived to revise his work
he would undoubtedly either have corrected his assertions or confirmed them. According
to Dr. Wegeler (this is the younger Wegeler’s argument, in brief), Beethoven had
been introduced to the von Breuning family at least as early as 1785, and in that circle
had already met Count Waldstein, who had aided him in securing his first salary as
Court Organist. The “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Notizen</span>” do not fix the dates, though they imply that the
occurrences took place before 1785. As to the statement of the Widow Karth, Wegeler
urges that the testimony of a child five years old could have no weight as against that
of persons of mature age, and that an acquaintance might well exist without intercourse
in the Beethoven dwelling. The letter to Dr. Schaden, the product of a melancholy
mood, does not preclude the possibility that Beethoven had received help from another
source, especially since great care had to be exercised in extending succor to him lest
his sensibilities be hurt. Certain it is that Wegeler, who did not go to Vienna till 1787,
had been a faithful friend and helper in the period of Beethoven’s destitution, as was
proved by a thitherto unpublished letter of Beethoven to Wegeler, in which the former
expressly stated that the latter had known him, Beethoven, almost since childhood. If
the von Breuning family were really not on hand at the time of Beethoven’s trouble,
the fact might be explained by their annual sojourn in the country, which was generally
of considerable duration. Thayer’s assumption that Wegeler himself did not get
intimately acquainted with the von Breunings until after his return from Vienna (in
1789) is at variance with the family recollections, which presented him as a young student
(therefore before 1787) and with him Beethoven at the time when they became visitors
at the house. Weakness of memory on the part of a man so intellectually fresh and
vigorous as Dr. Wegeler was in 1838 (he died ten years later) was not to be assumed;
least of all can Dr. Wegeler have erred concerning the beginning of his acquaintance
with the family from which he got his wife. Finally, the intimate terms of friendship
which existed between Beethoven and Eleonore von Breuning could be fully explained
only on the theory of a childhood acquaintance.
</p>
<p>
In the first edition of Thayer’s biography (1866) Dr. Deiters printed the text
bearing on this question as it is given above without note or comment. In the revised
edition of Volume I (1901), he reproduced the original text in the body of the page but
appended a footnote in which, while asserting that an authority like Thayer ought not
to be opposed except “with great diffidence and extreme caution” (to use Thayer’s
words referring to Dr. Wegeler), he nevertheless upheld the contention of Dr. Wegeler’s
grandson. He says: “The definite assertion of Wegeler that he made the acquaintance
of Beethoven as early as 1782, which is supported by Beethoven’s own words, ‘you
knew me almost since my childhood,’ is not to be shaken. As little can it be questioned
that Wegeler had been introduced in the Breuning house as a student before his departure
for Vienna (according to Gerhard von Breuning before his acquaintance with
Beethoven began); here Dr. Wegeler could not have made an error. Concerning his
bringing Beethoven to the house he gives no date; the year 1785 is not mentioned
in the “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Notizen</span>.” On page 45, however, it is stated that Stephan von Breuning “lived
in closest affiliation with him (Beethoven) from his tenth year till his death.” Stephan
was born August 17, 1774 (<i>Vide</i> “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Aus dem Schwarzspanierhause</span>,” page 6); this would
indicate the year 1784. Wegeler’s remark, “especially after you lost your noble
mother,” makes it clear as day that a close friendship existed before the death of
Beethoven’s mother.”</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_39_39" id="Footnote_39_39"></a><a href="#FNanchor_39_39"><span class="label">[39]</span></a> Dr. Deiters, differing with Thayer on the subject of the date of the beginning
of the intimacy between Beethoven and the von Breuning family, omitted in the revised
version of the Beethoven biography the author’s comments on the brief biographical
data concerning the sons, which were as follows: “These dates, communicated by Dr.
Gerhard, son of Stephan von Breuning, prove a singular inaccuracy in Wegeler’s remark
(‘<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Nachtrag zur Notizen</span>,’ page 26): ‘Lenz, as the youngest of the three brothers, was
nearest to Beethoven in age.’” Of Stephan he says: “Inasmuch as he had lived in intimate
association with Beethoven from his tenth year up to his death.” Many a proof
of this general fact will hereafter appear; but whether this “intimate association” began
quite so early is a question. The two were at the same time pupils of Franz Ries on
the violin, and they may well have become acquainted in 1785 or 1786; but it was not
favorable to extreme intimacy that four years’ difference existed in their ages; and that
the one was but a schoolboy while the other was already an organist, an author and
accustomed to move among men.</p></div>

date of the beginning of the acquaintance between Beethoven and the von Breunings,
falls foul of even this ingenious demonstration, saying that the incident of the conflagration
might have taken place when Count Waldstein was at home visiting his mother.
He could not believe that the Count had spent all of the first 24 years of his life at Dux
in “idyllic solitude,” and argued that he might have visited Bonn <i>for the first time</i> at an
earlier date than 1787. Dr. Deiters held that the point was well taken; as if there was
no alternative for the young count between “idyllic solitude” at Dux and a sojourn
at Bonn!</p></div>

when he had attained the highest degree of fame, composed years before at Bonn,
previous to his departure for Vienna; and in like manner other trifles, written for
albums, etc., were secretly taken from him and published.”</p></div>

music which Abbé Dobbeler carried with him to England must have been a manuscript
copy. Dr. Deiters, accepting without attempt at contradiction Thayer’s proof of its
origin at a period not later than 1792, nevertheless puts forth the conjecture that the
work may have been revised and reconstructed at a later date in Vienna, as was the case
with other compositions. It is not to be supposed, he urges, that Beethoven, enjoying
the celebrity that he did in 1797, would have published then with an opus number a
production of his youth without first subjecting it to a thorough revision. Moreover,
his earlier chamber compositions were in three movements, the minuet having been
added for the first time in the Octet. It was scarcely conceivable that he should have
simultaneously conceived a work in six movements unless he had had a Mozart model in
his mind. But why not? We have seen from the story of the music admired at the
court of Vienna from which the Elector came that the serenade form was in favor there.
The Sonata for Pianoforte and Violoncello which Artaria announced in May, 1807, is an
arrangement of this Trio, but it was not made by Beethoven.</p></div>

not written by Beethoven at the age of 15, but long after the pianoforte quartets, the
freedom in invention and development, the large dimensions of the free fantasia portion,
its almost imperceptible return to the principal theme, and the introduction of a coda in
the first movement. <i>Motivi</i> from this movement recur in later works, for instance, the
Sonata in F minor, Op.&nbsp;2, and the Pianoforte Concerto in C major. Beethoven seems
to have used the designation “Scherzo” in it for the first time.</p></div>

in the letter to Eleonore von Breuning (“I never would have written it in this way,” etc.)

investigators had discovered in the British Museum four thitherto unknown Beethoven
autographs amongst manuscripts purchased by Julian Marshall. The editor of the
second edition of Köchel’s “Thematic Catalogue of Mozart’s Works” had seen the
manuscripts and included two of them as authentic Mozart compositions and two as
probably such in the supplement to that work. They were a Trio in D, for pianoforte,
violin and violoncello (two pages of the first <i>Allegro</i> missing, listed as K, No. 52a);
three pieces for pianoforte, four hands, a <i>Gavotte</i> in F, an <i>Allegro</i> in B-flat, and a <i>Marcia
lugubre</i> in C minor (six measures), No. 71a; a <i>Rondo</i> in B-flat, to which the editor assigned
the year 1786, No. 511a; and a <i>Menuet</i> in C, for orchestra, the first of a set composed by
Beethoven in 1795, which M. Chantavoine published in 1903 under the title “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Douze
Menuets inédits pour Orchestre. L. van Beethoven. Œuvres posthumes. Au Ménestrel.</span>”
Theodore Wyzewa and Georges de St. Foix made a study of the manuscripts and
discussed them in “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Le Guide Musical</span>” of December, 1919, January and February, 1920.
They were then set down as “pseudo-Mozarts.” M. Charles Malherbe declared that
none of the compositions was in Mozart’s hand, and M. de St. Foix, after further consideration
of the internal evidence, declared them all to be indubitably by Beethoven and gave
his reasons in an essay published in “The Musical Quarterly” (New York and Boston,
G. Schirmer) of April, 1920. He told the history of the manuscripts as follows: “They
had been presented by the Emperor of Austria to the Sultan Abdul Aziz. The latter,
who probably cared very little for these relics of the 18th century, presented them in
turn to his musical director, Guatelli Pasha. An English collector, Julian Marshall,
purchased them from the Pasha’s son, W. Guatelli Bey, and when, later on, the British
Museum acquired the Marshall Collection these manuscripts went over into its
possession.”

<p>
The <i>Gavotte</i> was played at a concert of the Beethoven Association in New York
in January, 1920, by Madame Samaroff and Harold Bauer, being inserted as a movement
in the Sonata in A major for four hands, Op.&nbsp;6. Mr. Bauer also made an arrangement
for two hands which has been published by G. Schirmer.</p></div>

very effectually disproved the old belief touching the sterility of the Bonn period. The
inquiry which might still be pursued now is whether or not other compositions which
have been attributed to a later period may not also have been composed, or at least
projected and sketched, in Bonn. The point of view has changed, but what Thayer
wrote over half a century ago is still so largely pertinent that it is here given in the body
of the text with only such modifications as were necessary to bring it into harmony with

believed that it was of a much earlier date; and may, indeed, have been written before
Beethoven went to Vienna. For his theory Dr. Deiters found a plausible argument in
the spelling of the name with a “w” instead of a “v,” and the reiterated references to a misunderstanding
which had long been made right. The letter has no date or superscription
and Wegeler assumed that it was the continuation of one whose first page had
been lost. If the letter was written in Bonn it would prove that the Rondo (probably
that in G for Pianoforte and Violin, B. and H. Series XII, No. 102) was composed
before the beginning of the Viennese period; which might well be. The Sonata is probably
the unfinished one in C, dedicated to Eleonore von Breuning.</p></div>

corresponded with each other for a time, but the majority of Beethoven’s letters are
lost. While a student at the University in Leipzig, Amenda’s grandson placed some
of them in the hands of a publisher at his request and did not get them back. Amenda
was first a private teacher, became a preacher in Talsen in 1802, provost of the diocese

an anecdote told by Doležalek to Otto Jahn, Kraft once complained that a passage
was not playable. “It’s got to be,” answered Beethoven. In a like vein K. Holz
relates that “Beethoven asked an excellent artist whether or not certain things were
possible”; the question of how difficult they were did not enter. Thus Friedlowsky
for clarinet, Czerwensky for oboe, Hradezky and Herbst for horn. If others complained
of impossibilities the answer was “They can do it and you must.” (From Thayer’s

necessarily evaporates in any attempt to translate its Viennese colloquialisms.
“Herzens Natzerl” is to be understood as “Dear little Ignacius of my heart,” Nazerl
being an affectionate diminutive of Ignaz or Ignacius. Why it should have been applied
to Hummel, whose Christian names were Johann Nepomuk, does not appear. “Mehlschöberl”
is a term which has survived in the Austrian cuisine of to-day, the article
itself being a sort of soup dumpling.</p></div>

referred in tracing the history of Beethoven’s compositions. A collection of sketches
formerly owned by J. N. Kafka and now in the British Museum was described by
Mr. J. S. Shedlock in “The Musical Times” (July to December, 1892). A volume

235, now No. 10 in the Tiefen Graben which, slightly altered, still remains. On
the strength of Czerny’s statement that one had to look up to the fifth or sixth storey
to see Beethoven, and the old report that Beethoven lived “in the Kleine Weintraube,”
Frimmel was led to think that possibly he lived in one of the houses on the higher ground
behind the Greiner house to which there was access from the open place “Am Hof”
as well as from the houses in the Tiefen Graben and the Greiner house. The houses
which bore the sign “Zur Weintraube” were situated “am Hofe.”</p></div>

to Breitkopf and Härtel on the same day contains the equivalent of the remark: “I
am for the present keeping the better ones for myself until I make a tour,” which is
significant, since it makes it sure that other concertos were at least planned and that

were taught to hear in its first movement a lament for unrequited love and reflected
that it was dedicated to the Countess Giulia Guicciardi, for whom Beethoven assuredly
had a tender feeling. Moonlight and the plaint of an unhappy lover. How affecting!
But Beethoven did not compose the Sonata for the Countess, though he inscribed it to
her. He had given her a Rondo, and wishing to dedicate it to another pupil, he asked
for its return and in exchange sent the Sonata. Moreover, it appears from evidence
scarcely to be gainsaid, that Beethoven never intended the C-sharp minor sonata as a
musical expression of love, unhappy or otherwise. In a letter dated January 22, 1892
(for a copy of which I am indebted to Fräulein Lipsius [La Mara] to whom it is addressed),
Alexander W. Thayer, the greatest of Beethoven’s biographers, says: ‘That Mr. Kalischer
has adopted Ludwig Nohl’s strange notion of Beethoven’s infatuation for Therese
Malfatti, a girl of fourteen years, surprises me; as also that he seems to consider the
C-sharp minor Sonata to be a musical love-poem addressed to Julia Guicciardi. He
ought certainly to know that the subject of that sonata was or rather that it was suggested
by&mdash;Seume’s little poem ‘<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Die Beterin</span>’.’ The poem referred to describes a
maiden kneeling at the high altar in prayer for the recovery of a sick father. Her
sighs and petitions ascend like the smoke of incense from the censers, angels come to
her aid, and, at the last, the face of the suppliant one glows with the transfiguring
light of hope. The poem has little to commend it as an example of literary art and it
is not as easy to connect it in fancy with the last movement of the sonata as with the
first and second: but the evidence that Beethoven paid it the tribute of his music seems
conclusive.”&mdash;“The Pianoforte and its Music,” by H. E. Krehbiel, Charles Scribner’s
Sons, pp. 163, 164.
</p>
<p>
On page 174, Vol. IV, of the German edition of this biography Dr. Deiters remarks:
“The venerated Thayer, it is true, conceived the idea that Beethoven’s Fantasia and
Sonata, Op.&nbsp;27, No. 2, had been inspired by Seume’s ‘<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Beterin</span>.’ Whoever compares the
sonata with the poem will soon realize that there can be no thought of this. We have
here, no doubt, a confusion of pieces. It would be easier to think of the Fantasia, Op.
77. Kalischer, who first recognized Thayer’s error, thought of the C-sharp minor
Quartet; but this cannot have been in Beethoven’s mind, for it was composed much
later.” Grossheim’s letter was written in 1819; the C-sharp minor quartet was composed
in 1826. So Kalischer was ridiculously in error. But why does Dr. Deiters
suggest the Fantasia, Op.&nbsp;77? Grossheim was a musician&mdash;composer, teacher and conductor&mdash;as
well as philologist, and when he said “C-sharp minor” it is not likely that he
was thinking of a work in G minor. Moreover, the most admirable Dr. Deiters to the
contrary notwithstanding, it is not at all difficult to associate the sonata with the poem
whose picture of lamentable petition and rising clouds of incense is strikingly reproduced
in suggestion by the music of the first movement. Serene hopefulness can be
said to be the feeling which informs the second movement; and why should the finale
not be the musician’s continuation of the poet’s story?</p></div>

to admit that the author’s argument against the Countess Guicciardi as the lady to
whom the famous love-letter which is the basis of the episode referred to by the author,
has been disproved; or that the burden of proof is against Thayer’s theory (never put
forward as a demonstrated fact, but rather as what the scientists call a “working hypothesis”)
that the object of his love at the time the letter was written was the Countess
Therese Brunswick (or Brunsvik, as the Hungarian branch of the family wrote the
name). The question is one of great difficulty, however, and the Editor has thought
it wise, expedient and only fair to the memory of Mr. Thayer, to bring together the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">disjecta membra</i> of his argument as they are to be found in the body of Vol. II and the
body and Appendices of Vol. III of the original German edition, in a continuous chapter,
and then to add, in the form of a comprehensive postscript, an abstract of the opinion
of others and some suggestions of his own touching the woman who, though not yet
definitively identified, wears the halo which streams from the title which Beethoven
bestowed upon her&mdash;his “Immortal Beloved.” It will be observed that the question
turns largely on an adjustment of dates&mdash;a necessary procedure in other affairs of
Beethoven’s besides those of his heart.</p></div>

 Jahn transcribes the last words (“<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">je la méprisois</i>,” <i>etc.</i>) as follows: <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Elle est née
Guicciardi elle étoit</i> (an illegible word marked with an interrogation point) <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">qu epouse de
lui (avant son voyage) de l’Italie. Arrivée à Vienne et elle cherchoit moi pleurant, mais je
la méprisois.</i>
</p>
<p>
Ludwig Nohl asserts that the words “<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">arrivée à Vienne</i>” had been “added” by
Schindler. But Schindler printed the passage in 1845 as well as in 1860 thus: <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Elle
étoit l’épouse de lui avant son voyage en Italie.... Arrivée a Vienne elle cherchoit moi
pleurant</i>, <i>etc.</i> In the edition of 1860 of his biography of Beethoven he adds the following
remark: “One of the conversation books of 1823, all of which are preserved in the Royal
Court Library at Berlin, contains these revelations.” If Nohl’s assertion is correct
it follows that Schindler lied and deceived the public, being guilty of a forgery which
escaped the eyes of both Jahn and Thayer; and that, furthermore, he was guilty of
the folly of calling attention to the very book whose contents he had falsified. Nohl
asserts further that Giulietta had sought an interview with Beethoven before her journey
to Italy. On such an act he founds the assertion that the young woman, married only
a few months, was already willing to leave her husband. From circumstances unknown
to Nohl it is certain that the visit did not take place until after her return to Vienna
in 1822.</p></div>

This picture went from the possession of the widow of Beethoven’s nephew Karl into
that of Georg Hellmesbeger Sr. in 1861 and was presented by his grandson to the
Beethoven-Haus Verein in Bonn, where it is now preserved. It is, in all probability,
the portrait of which Beethoven speaks in a letter to Count Franz von Brunswick,
dated July 11, 1811: “Since I do not know how the portrait fell into your hands, it
would be best were you to bring it with you; an amiable artist will no doubt be found
who will copy it for the sake of friendship.” Besides the portrait of the Countess
Therese there was also a medallion picture of the Countess Guicciardi amongst the
effects left by Beethoven. It was identified as such by her son, who died in 1893. (See
Breuning, “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Aus dem Schwarzspanierhause</span>,” p. 124.)</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_127_127" id="Footnote_127_127"></a><a href="#FNanchor_127_127"><span class="label">[127]</span></a> Riemann in his revision of Vol. II of this biography says, “The statement in the
second and third volumes of the first edition were based on the belief that the serious
marriage project of Beethoven which led him to ask Wegeler to get for him [a transcript
of] his baptismal certificate, but which fell through soon after, must needs be
connected with the person to whom the love-letter was addressed. But since it has
been determined by a careful study of Clementi’s letters that Beethoven’s offer of
marriage, in 1810, most certainly referred to Therese von Malfatti, who, however, as
we shall see, cannot be considered in connection with the love-letter, this combination
is become untenable. A large number of Beethoven’s letters must be assigned to
entirely different years, because Clementi’s correspondence with his partner Collard
makes it certain that the honorarium for the works sold in 1807 was not paid out till
the spring of 1810. The relations of Beethoven to Therese Malfatti are thus transferred
from 1807 to 1809-1810, and it can no longer be maintained that 1810 was the year
in which Beethoven’s prospect of a marriage with Therese Brunswick came to an end.”
This means that Dr. Riemann believes that while a man of 38 years of age would not
write a love-letter like Beethoven’s to a girl of less than 14 years he would try to marry
her when he was 40 and she a trifle under 16.</p></div>

been discovered in a mass of loose papers purchased by the elder Artaria at the sale
of Beethoven’s effects in 1827. Endorsed upon it is an acknowledgement, signed by
Jacob Hotschevar, the guardian (after Breuning’s death) of the composer’s nephew,
of having received it from Artaria &amp; Co. Then follows a similar acknowledgement
of its reception by Johann van Beethoven. Its next possessor appears to have been
Alois Fuchs&mdash;the great collector of musical manuscripts and autographs of musicians.
In 1855, it was purchased by Ernst, the violinist (of whom is not known?), who presented
it to Mr. Otto and Madame Jenny Lind Goldschmidt as a testimony of gratitude for
their valuable assistance in one of his concerts. By their kindness the present writer
was allowed to make a very careful copy on April 2, 1861. As printed in the “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Allg.
Musikalische Zeitung</span>,” by Schindler and others, it differs little from the original, though
some of Beethoven’s peculiar forms of spelling were corrected&mdash;such as “Heiglnstadt.”
“That Beethoven, throughout the document, never mentions the name of his second
brother Johann, and indicates it only by points, is surprising and singular, inasmuch
as this brother, as we have just seen, had come to Vienna only a short time before in
order to take part in the affairs of our Beethoven.” Our copy certainly contains no
such “points.” The other mistake, as to the recent arrival of Johann in Vienna, every
reader will note.</p></div>

“Life,” was not disposed to permit the author’s defence of Beethoven’s brothers to
stand unchallenged, as Dr. Deiters had done in the first edition. Dr. Riemann calls
attention to a letter sent by Beethoven to Johann after the latter had removed to
Linz&mdash;the date as written by Beethoven is “March 28, 1089”&mdash;another instance of
Beethoven’s careless treatment of such matters. Of course the year was 1809. In
the letter the composer says: “God grant to you and the other brother instead of his
<i>unfeelingness, feeling&mdash;I suffer infinitely through him</i>, with my bad hearing I always
need somebody, and whom shall I trust?” This Dr. Riemann inserts in the body of
the text. In a foot-note he calls attention to a letter found among Thayer’s posthumous
papers to the author from Gerhard von Breuning in which occur the words: “Caspar
held a respected position in the public service. But how did it come that Rösgen
warned my father to warn Ludwig not to trust Caspar too much in respect of money
matters because he had a bad reputation; and then, Ludwig having told Caspar that
he had received the warning from Steffen, Caspar demanded from my father to know
from whom he had received the warning; and when my father refused because he
had promised Rösgen on his word of honor not to betray him, Caspar rudely pressed
my father, publicly delivered letters containing abuse and threats to the porter of the
Court Council of War, etc., and&mdash;that my father, calling Ludwig a gossip, was long
estranged from him until the letter of reconciliation came (in 1804).” Breuning’s
utterances in his book “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Aus dem Schwarzspanierhause</span>” are of similar import. There
are evidences that Breuning was convinced that Carl’s character was bad, but is more
lenient in his judgment of Johann, whom he charges only with greed and miserliness.
Of course, all this material was in the hands of Thayer, who must have weighed it in
making up his defence of the brothers.</p></div>

In reproducing two <i>facsimiles</i> of portions of the Bagatelle in question (“<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Beethoven
Jahrbuch</span>” II, 1909) he says: “The apparent contradictions disclosed by these
manuscripts led Thayer to question the authenticity of the autograph. It may safely
be said that a later consideration of the matter would have led Thayer to change his
mind; he would also surely have corrected his statement that Ries had reference to
the Bagatelles Op.&nbsp;33 in his ‘N’ (p. 124). Nottebohm knew the manuscript, which
was once in the possession of Johann Kafka, well and never expressed a doubt as to
its genuineness.”</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_138_138" id="Footnote_138_138"></a><a href="#FNanchor_138_138"><span class="label">[138]</span></a> Dr. Riemann thinks that Beethoven originally wrote “1802” on the autograph,
and that subsequently he, or somebody else, changed the 8 into a 7 and the 0 into an
8. (See the <i>facsimile</i> in Frimmel’s “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Beethovenjahrbuch</span>” of 1909); yet the German
Editor finds suggestions of Beethoven’s latest style in the “Bagatelles” and calls attention
to the fact that Beethoven detected intimations of No. 5 in the set Op.&nbsp;119 in the Kessler
sketchbook. Dr. Riemann’s conclusion is thus worded: “If Ries in his ‘<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Notizen</span>’ meant
these ‘Bagatelles’, he was surely in error. Beethoven’s complaint to Breitkopf and
Härtel in the letter of October, 1803, ‘since unfortunately so many unlucky old things
of mine have been sold and stolen,’ cannot possibly have referred to them. Beethoven
himself thought highly of these ‘trifles’, as is shown by his anger at Peters’s depreciation
of Op.&nbsp;119. it is very likely that Ries meant the Two Preludes in all the
Keys (Op.&nbsp;39), which may have been surreptitiously published.”</p></div>
